This is perhaps your own individual experience OP.Classic case of a person not being right all the time on all topics.

Nevertheless, country needs a men's commission, period.Better put.Your points are good, but you need to put them out in a better way. It seems like you are defending our education system's pitfalls. Which you aren't.Patent and research is based on how those things are perceived by college level students and infra provided to them. Keyword being infra here, again, India lacks in it but you are only partially correct here. In last 5-6 years there has been a push towards patents, but we still have a long way to go, that's a given.While our education system lacks many things, US and Canada's education system isn't a standard to emulate. The only so called golden standard would be Finnish education system or Nordic education system as a whole. US has summer schools, remedial teaching, private tutoring too.Means nada. Pretense is their motto.Well, he's concussed, hence the bent conclusions.Succinctly put, brilliant.Your posts and comments reek of excessive South simping OP. Odisha is an Eastern state.

Also, for civil students NICMAR after your degree will help. Google it. Since currently your 2nd semester is going on and in most colleges, course is common across branches in first year, there's a scope of changing your branch in 2nd year.

I have stated atleast 2 times before that jurisprudence needs to mature and let counter suing be an option. Moreover, false accusations destroy lives, there's a clear need for retroactive mechanisms there too. I have worked with NGOs and know for a fact how women extort money in the name of levying make cases, it's about providing equivalent judicial representation to atleast 500 million people. It's about their basic life to not be accused in false cases and then live a life of slander. 'justice' in India tales eons and the whole system is setup to mooch the husband. Heck, he has to even bear the costs of lawyer that his wife hires in these cases. You keep on pontificating on semantics and I have already provided the solution in plain sight. To repeat myself once again, redundantly so; laws need to be gender agnostic and there needs to be a properly established redressal mechanism for levying fale cases on both the accuser and her counsel(s). There also needs to be proper jail time, provisions for punitive damage amount collection for lying under oath in the court of law.Itna sach bhi nahi bolna tha.A majority of people don't have a problem with marital rape law. The problem lies in proving it and subsequent zero safeguard for the wrongly accused. And given how previously stated laws have been blatantly misused in addendum with absolutely turd tier attitude of jurisprudence when it comes to male matters makes matters even more difficult. That's why I previously stated problem is grave from both ends, tooting the horn for a single gender isn't going to do anything, especially when laws like rape under the pretext of marriage exist.Why shouldn't they? It's not like courts do not indulge in pettty statements. Pardiwala stated, 'your lose tongue set the country on fire' there was no relevance to the case, another judge in a lower court when faced with domestic violence upon husband stated, 'prasad samajh ke kha lo'. These are just a couple of examples. In this case at least it'd have made perfect sense.And? Did the complainant specifically state marital rape of male to female? Even if he did, isn't right honorable Gujarat HC responsible enough to make it gender agnostic?My point is very simple, right honorable Gujarat HC made a one sided observation. Rape is rape, irrespective of gender and marital status. Preachy, 'independant' institutions indulging in such sexist remarks deracinates masses against atleast 500 million people in the country. If they and you want people to take the base argument seriously then you and them also need to duly consider that fake cases for harassment of male gender are quite rampant and in absence of any safeguards undue disadvantage will befall males in marriages. It already is rampant through the provisions I have previously listed. Exceptionally righteous, perfectly honorable SC of India rejected the petition for a national men's commission on extremely flimsy grounds just a couple of months ago. The problem is serious from both ends, and country's jurisprudence as an 'independant' institution needs to show maturity.Make a post on right honorable Kerala HC's take and I will comment on it.I agree, kindly make that clear to the right honorable Gujarat HC. I never even said that marital rape law shouldn't be a reality. But then it will need additional safeguards for the wrongly accused. The jurisprudence needs to grow up and talk about prospects of counter suing being a reality and lying under oath having repercussions for females. Without all of this, this law will go the way of 498a, HMA, 354, 354(A,B,C,D), 366A, 376(A,C,D), Section 67 of IT act, PoSH act 2013, Domestic violence act 2005. Also, marital rape law is already enforced through 376B up to a certain degree.I understood what you said mate. But our judiciary won't care if a woman states anything in court.Make a separate post for that then. This isn't about politics. You are venting in the wrong thread.I already gave you the answer to the statement made by the right honorable Gujarat HC. Make the laws gender agnostic, it's as simple as that.Yes, people without a modicum of respect towards representatives of democractic institutions cannot run a country. Which is really sad considering the ones acting like troglodytes are MPs.In addendum to you statement, they'll preach vehemently without any actual actionable items.If she states that she was coerced into making that statement, then her word will be assumed correct and Mr. Jotaniya is then royally screwed.Straight to jail without bailThat'd be disregarded as evidence of the court feels like it. Some HC had already issued a statement last year or so that recording a wife's call as evidence of infidelity for granting divorce is infringing on her basic rights. In the same vein, if the woman says that she was coerced then the consented video will be chucked out of evidence.That's exactly the scenario where IPC 376 is used blatantly. In Indian jurisprudence there's no space for counter suing and claiming punitive damages. There's almost zero repercussions for making false claims, if made by female gender. Heck, Indian judiciary doesn't consider men can be raped. In these cases, the man has to prove his innocence rather than accuser proving their claim. That itself is against the natural flow of justice. The sexist statement made by Gujarat high court disregards studies upon studies that female to male sexual violence is a reality in today's world. But there are exactly zero laws to tackle it. Regular people don't want to even accept that female to male sexual violence can even happen. Just make the laws gender agnostic the solution is that simple.This is the spirit of democracy that they want.Well, 'celebrities' are hypocrites of the tallest order, all around the world. That's a given. OP, your post's zeal is quite spot on. Paraphrasing properly is required though. As the infamous line goes, jab tak cinema hai log__.This isn't exclusive to only moving picture arts though, any kind of performance artist in today's world will mostly be a stuffy pretentious snoot. They advertise for stuff that they'll never touch in a thousand years, while their minions will project that accountability lies with the consumer and not the advertiser. All the while user will be influenced with their bile. Same goes for their performances, lifestyle and actions in general.Again with the circular argument. You really have a comprehension issue it seems.Where's the development dude? Most village dwellerrs still have to go more than a distance of 40kms to reach the nearest PHC. Public transport outside of capital city area is non-existent. Constant powercuts is a recurrent issue. Almost no white collar jobs and whatever blue collar jobs are present, even those don't pay properly, hence Odias have to go to other states. There's a reason so many of our labor class work in Surat. How exactly will a party that's never been in power in the state do anything? That was the whole point of my first comment. You are making a circular argument sans basic common sense. BJD has had enough time to tackle the grassroot issues and they haven't done that. Toot their horn all you want to, doesn't change the reality. And seriously, stop with the racial diatribe or 'Cow belt'.Normal people aren't as they are busy trying to just survive. Most people here come from a bit of so called privileged background. They have found jobs, education and such in either state capital city area or in metro cities. They aren't privy to the poor, labor class of the state. I come from one of the most impoverished areas of the state and have seen how our diaspora struggles everywhere. Shitting on North and other states hence seems irrational to me personally, but seems to be a rampant theme here. Heck, most of my comments here are downvoted, even though I rarely get emotional. Nevertheless, my state pride doesn't come from a place of arrogance, rather I believe in self improvement.Why do you think we make 'model minority' in other countries? Even after being the 'model minority' outside of protected spaces Indian diaspora makes for the easiest target of racial diatribe.Yeah, they're notorious to grab genitals if men decide not to pay them is my experience. Each to their own.Dead spot on.That's the nature of this sub, anything positive for UP, Bihar will be vehemently downvoted.An exceptionally lame comment from such username. Goes to show your indifference or rather lack of understanding of my comment. BJP in our state will be a net positive. Also, I saw your ridiculous comment of calling WB as cow belt. Indulge in namecalling all you want doesn't change the truth that we as a state have a very long way to go and BJD in its current form isn't/hasn't/won't doing/done/do the needful. Especially with an educated strata like ours that resorts to using jibes such as, 'cow belt' and indulge in the excessively moronic and ironic North-south divide nonsense.Synopsys isn't a semiconductor company per say. It provides tools for semiconductor industry. Mostly verification tools. Also, bringing it isn't that significant of an achievement.

Also, given the time BJD has governed the state, they haven't done nearly enough. Especially outside of the capital region, we still lack severely in basic infrastructure. BJP currently sits at the centre and funding for such basic infrastructure can be easily done.Yes, this is for real and Gandhi gave such statements during other incidents too. Most of those statements have now been relegated to books only and are not presented to students as history. Moreover, Bengal and its adjacent Bangladesh still faces this issue, all the while various vested political, news, intellectual and judicial interests ignore such incidents comfortably or twist the issue altogether. Just like these riots were presented as a class struggle.I am astounded abhi tak kisi 'dog lovers' ne tumko hound nahi Kiya hai.Wo nahi ho sakta, due legislative process ke baad paas huye laws par time waste karna hai to batao.The law under scanner here i.e. IPC 376 is prejudiced and predatory in nature. In a live-in relationship being physically active is assumed. However, if under any circumstance the male feels like that the particular relationship isn't something he wants to continue with, women use this law. Two finger test is banned under SC guidelines as it is supposed to be. Proving rape through medical means is very difficult as it is. Moreover, if the coitus was consensual and allegations come afterwards how exactly is the accused going to prove their innocence? As I said, the law is prejudiced and predatory.  Moreover, false accusations don't carry any repercussions largely for women in India. Also, counter suing motions are rejected by lower courts at their preliminary phases in quite large numbers. As I also stated previously, Indian law does not follow the nature course of justice, viz. the accuser proving the allegation isn't followed in cases relating to women. All the onus lies with the accused to clear his name.

Edit: I think when one counter sues and adds punitive damages as a measure there are some weird rules too. One of which is I think to put some percentage of said amount as escrow deposit with the court. Though I will have to read up on it to confirm this.This act is used to levy rape charges by jilted females whenever their relationships go haywire. How exactly is one going to prove rape in such cases if a person decides to break-up? Also, how does one prove 'pretext' of marriage with complete conviction? Additionally in such cases, it's upon the guy to prove his innocence not the girl to provide evidence. This itself is against the natural flow of justice. Legal cases in India have a very long average time of completion, the said time drains resources viz. time, money, sometimes jobs, reputation and many others from the 'accused'. Men in India currently don't have any legal or social safeguards against false allegations both pre and post such allegations are made. And such cases are quite common. Heck , judiciary doesn't even see it fit that there should be a men's commission even when it comes to such cases. You can Google the pathetic words they used while rejecting the petition for setting up of a national men's commision just a couple of months ago. Law has to be gender agnostic.Read about section 376 of IPC.You've summarised the whole issue very succinctly. Brilliant.The sanest comment in this entire thread. Damn, spot on.That's spot on.Itna sach bhi nahi bolna tha.Sure, generalize more than 500 million males based on trashy people around you. That's the most productive way to tackle problems.This is about negligence, not capitalism.OP, if you are a woman with elderly parents, visit the nearest police chowky and inform them of the situation. The next time this happens call them directly.Spot on, but complaining about this will swiftly devolve into a 'society against the youth' situation.Yeah man. South has no violence whatsoever, it's funny how the movie is directed by a South Indian.![gif](giphy|1j9OduPavQDl0hMd0K)Emmy RossumSpot on.Sure mate, what happened years, even decades preceeding 1984? Buses with Hindus weren't burned? Extra judicial killings of Hindus weren't carried out by khalistani terrorists is it? How casually you omitted everything just to paint one sided word picture. Kanishka bombing didn't happen? Temples weren't broken? Perhaps clear your version of myopic history first.The bon homie is just good PR at this point. The mutual visiting of religious places is lopsided too, more Hindus in Gurudwaras, while the inverse isn't true.Yeah sure, give a fair wage, nobody is asking anything for free from you mate.It's least evil of all the ways to govern people. That being said our current system is extremely inept in addressing the diversity of thoughts that we have. It also panders to certain stratas of the society way more and hence ends up monkey balancing each and every problem. Take for example any law passed in the last 4 years and the 'discussion' that happens around it.Bureaucracy and unrequited projection of power goes hand in hand. Especially in India, she knows very well that those guys won't be able to retaliate or question her. If morality is to be exerted here then she needs to raid the brothels operating in the area. This is harassment.Prostitution is legal as it forms a part of individual bodily freedom, brothels and pimping are illegal as they are social evils.Provisions already exist for the same under IT act and many other acts. It's not just about strengthening the law, this seems about being draconian. I highly doubt the bureaucracy and other two branches will even be slightly effective in actually taking action where necessary. If that was possible then Zubair who dogwhistled by the means of a doctored video would have been prosecuted. Same with STSJ gang. Freedom of speech is as expected in this secular nation, very very selective.

Ironically something akin to this was passed today in Irish parliament also, wanting to stifle 'elements' that rioted when an immigrant stabbed children a couple of days ago.Not ironic, that's rhetoric to hide their heinous past.Good effort OP. That sub is a lost cause though, always was and will always be.That provision already exists and can/will be junked by court in a jiffy if they feel like it. Under HMA a woman can do no wrong whatsoever. Read about streedhan tenet in HMA and Google how it's used to take away things, especially jewellery received jointly as marriage gift.Don't forget nefarious NGOs that want laws to remain gender biased.Yup, bashing Hinduism with the choicest of biases and skewed researches presented by hypocritical researchers is a common theme across premier universities throughout the country and world at large. There's a reason, 'scholars' like Audrey, Yengde and Doniger exist. Matters are made even worse when such elements recieve validations from scholar community.Spot on.Spot on, Odisha isn't that far behind in that dhimmitude, especially the 'educated' youth strata.Good post OP, SC will swoop in take impromptu suo moto it anything happens to these annadaataas. Funny thing is, Punjab's groundwater situation is dire and rice shouldn't be grown in such climate, but who cares. Other parts of the country don't have annadaataas, only Punjab does.Sorry but didn't SC give them full fledged freedom to block everything during the first stir? Sure, the government too didn't show any backbone but other two pillars of 'democracy' should also be rebuked.Racist tendencies will have to be acknowledged from both sides first.SC regularly hinders on duly passed laws and regulations, they stopped the farm laws, there's a running case on legality of abrogation pf article 370 and many other such instances can be added. I see judiciary upholding constitutional framework in a very selective way; otherwise laws such as WAQF act, HMA, HR&CE act would never have seen the light of day. They never would have commented; 'a woman's lose tongue set the country on fire', Zubair would not have been so casually released, same with junior Owaisi, while casually stating that he didn't actually threaten. Manish Kashyap wouldn't have been in jail for more than 6 months just for asking questions. While people working directly with legislature can be changed through vox populi, judiciary has no real oversight and bureaucracy too has virtually no oversight. Hence the institution that takes suo moto on some actions and then goes completely blind on others is much more answerable here.Status quo won't change until costs are made to be recouped from vandals who do this to public property. It's a damn shame that SC rebuked such action when UP government tried it with 'protestors' some time back.So we have a CM who cannot read/write in state language and still reads scripts written in English. Next we will have a full blown CM without any of those capabilities. Nativity of the CM matters for a state, can an Odia ever be considered for CM candidature in Pandian's birthplace? The so called 'development' rhetoric of BJD is also through centre's support. State politics requires proper leaders now.It seems you have proper proof of a person being a terrorist. Kindly approach NIA with your proofs.You need to put some heft behind that statement by giving sources.Yeah, that's good observation.Ekadashi ho gayi parso, Prabhuji uth gaye hai.YesWell the same supreme court fined him a grand total of Re1 for contempt.Yeah, that's really something.

However, Venus also shows up during early mornings and evenings in the sky, hence the name.Come to the point already, your write-up is a nothing sandwich.Any city and state sub is infested with such people. Pune city sub is a prime example of such cringe.

Fine, kamasutra is a treatise and also talks about responsibilities of couples towards each other and the society. It also talks about age, play types, actions, aphrodisiacs and many other things. It's a very vast text and one of the many that come under kaam shastra. It's doesn't exclusively talk about homosexuality, it talks about a lot many things and in case your comprehension is weak, which it is; I never said anything against homosexuality itself. Also, never said anything about Western culture whatsoever. Your talk about Khajuraho is balderdash and hence I stated that exclusively.The apps themselves are a scam for men. Just Google or search on reddit for stories related to tinder premium and men's experiences.

Situation is far far worse for Indian men as they have no legal cover in case of a false allegation, heck sometimes legal counsels will dupe you brutally. While one maybe eventually acquitted, it will be time consuming, you most definitely will lose the will to live and will also lose money.

Basically zero respite. And the moment somebody points this, there will be people stating how women were opressed since time immemorial, hence men who actually have never thought of doing any such thing should bear some of it. Ironically, the country has more than 500 million males, and yet zero laws, legal structure, social support to represent them. It's tragic and funny at the same time.Everybody is trolled on the internet. Everybody needs support.Will the judge give this is writing?*Khajuraho. Also, depictions on outer walls on temples has no correlation. Inner sanctums don't have such depictions, as they are considered a part of Maya and are to be left behind, as one goes inside any temple. Make better cross correlations than this one. Some also have depictions of bestiality, do you want that to be legal as well? Also, just as a reminder, my reply isn't against the post itself, rather your misguided attempt of corroboration between two non linear events. Tumhe bhuankne ka shauk hai to achche se bhaunk lo fir. Gol mol na Karo. Samlaingik vivaah par jor dena hai, dete raho, saare ke saare marriage laws to civil union mein badlo aur saare laws to gender neutral kar do.

By better I mean you'd get a better audience to the question.I have worked with some addicts in my friend circle on a very hands on basis. Your first statement is utterly false.Nope, some addictions are a compulsion. Some are a deliberate choice.Because it's a Hindu 'majority'.Scared also provides with an adrenaline response.Shows Oxford's quality.Peak Indian secularismYup, but they won't.It took judicial setup 22 years to avoid 'justice'. Vigilantism is the natural course of action in such cases.Such people can be used for scientific research, human behaviour patterns is a fascinating field. Just like how inhuman experimentations during WWII lead to better understanding of human mind. Here the moral load of considering such person a sane entity goes away and experimentations, though still unethical maybe justified.The guy needs to be in some institution.You were just that angry at the teacher. Adrenaline helped you, I do believe you did that many situps. Anger is a great motivator.Subsequent harassment from hospital staff, legal hassles and such. Moreover, not every type of fire is created equal. Not everybody is equipped to handle it. Water isn't optimum to douse chemical and many types of fire. The incident is quite regretful but blaming onlookers isn't going to solve the core issue.I don't know. I wasn't there.Constitution says a lot of things and then contradicts itself through special provisions. An example would be definition of minorities, the basic definition is so broad that there cannot technically be a majority in the country.You can draw your own conclusions about it all. Human tendencies of bystander effect causes this. Either to stand and do nothing or make videos of it, as nothing else crosses their mind. Also, this behaviour isn't exclusive to Indians.I am aware of that. Taking videos is the least most people can do.No one wants to get entangled in the great Indian legal system. Most people dread it and avoid it more than the plague."There's no threat", SC if this goes to court. Referencing how he was let off for the infamous '15 minute' remark by SC.Spot on.Situations like these just get worse with expressions. As I said before, find another dwelling for your temporary stay. That's the best course of action.I get the frustration. But you really need to refrain from doing what you're planning on doing.OP, your agony is understandable. The action you are about to take is not. It's borderline endangerment. There's a reason people with varied eating habits do not cohabitate, you've just learned the reason, albeit in an obnoxious way from your viewpoint. Move out and find a different place to stay. And contrary to someone else in the comment section, you being called bigoted and casteist because of your food preferences is wrong.I personally don't care for any of the sports that you've listed. Heck I don't care for watching sports at all, it's the playing it that matters. Watching is an entertainment thing and adds nothing of value to me personally. The 'crowd' argument is exceptionally myopic is my point. If one wants matches to take place only in certain venues then they need to petition the governing body, in this case the BCCI to cancel the venue altogether. In the wake of the match, not only were the players abused but weirdly Gujaratis were also reeled into it. Goes to show, OP is also a bigot if not to the level of abusing a cricketer in his dms, then on the basis of state and language. Accept the bigotry at its face value and don't try to preach. A 'crowd' doesn't hold the distinction of monopoly over a sporting venue. This cringefest over a game venue makes no sense. OP also conveniently put aside how fans at Eden garden burned the stands when the saw the team losing. Nevertheless, fans are morons all around the world. It's nothing unique to cricket or even India. I have seen crowds go haywire in  Spain, Italy and many places when their clue loses a match. Some English football club fans used to be notorious for Street fights up until a decade ago.You've got a statewise breakup of crowd on that venue for that day? Any data set to back up your 'crowd' claim?Sure, then don't make blanket assumptions.Many people do move back and thrive.And why is this an 'India' moment? Any random person can slide into anybody's dm and state anything.A place not good for sanity.Yup, spot on.Poverty doesn't justify it.Good post OP and good decision to not post in any city sub.He can always fight for them with boots on ground in real-time.As unfortunate the incident itself is, for all the people commenting on no one doing anything reality is not what it seems. The first thing is, this happened way too fast for anyone to register and coherently react. Second, Google bystander syndrome, it's a legitimate thing. Most regular people aren't prepared for such sudden actions.Maybe they got their own tickets. Is there any official confirmation to their invitation?They aren't foolish. They are quite smart, they know the feeding hand is never going to stop. Hence these ungrateful SoBs will keep doing what they are doing. An overwhelming chunk of development funds and resources taken by Kashmir alone and we will keep getting this out of the situation.Thanks for the list in one of your previous replies. The point original poster wanted to make, albeit in a very crass way is many other states try to be as preachy as residents of Kolkata. I am not even talking about whole of WB here. And this coming from a state that is treated as utmost trash by your state.Nah man, they shouldn't do that too. They should hang tight and do Aman ki ashaYou didn't understand his comment. He means necrophilia was the reason for sati and jauhar.They'll also take a major chunk of tax paid for their 'upliftment'.This is just photo op with captions added. Neither understood either's language.Oh that abomination, I had repressed that memory.The old chaining your luggace to seat underwire will work here. Also, not opening doors without the presence of TTE and not leaving belongings unattended 3 stations before and after Balasore can be a good strategy. Also, don't use handheld devices in urinal and door area. Once a platform arrives, bolt the door facing non platform side.Irrelevant to the post topic. Things that OP states are actually happening, and the heads up is appreciated.1. Young kids should know their history, whether it's 'islamophopic' or not is irrelevant. Hiding the truth or rather sugarcoating it is what makes for complex problems. 

2. Every news outlet is agenda driven. You old grandparents watch a channel purely out of habit, they've had many years watching it and are not going to change that habit during their ripe years. 

3. What systematic oppression of Sikhs are you talking about? They have all rights and privileges accorded to a regular Indian citizen. Heck, if anything they have extra rights, like being given the right to carry weapons. The same birth right is accorded to many clans in the 'majority' religion, but the constitution does not recognise that. 

4. Punjab is not exclusively Sikh, it has at least 38% Hindus too. The number used to be higher earlier. The state of Punjab even with such a high second majority has never had a non sikh CM but the country of India has had a Sikh Prime minister and Sikhs have also held many other important portfolios.

5. Punjab water issue affects everyone in the area but both sides are adamant on their drivel. Punjab wants entire water volume from Sutlej Yamuna link, that's preposterous. 

6. During 'farmers' protest a man was lynched extremely brutally, tied to a cot, his hand first cut off with a blunt sword and then left to hang and die. All the while begging for death, he was accused of 'beadbi'. A woman was slapped by a jatthedaar for allegedly smoking in a Sikh religious structure, although no evidence was found, but she was brutally slapped. People were denied entry in another sikh structure for sporting the Indian flag on their face. A woman was murdered recently by another servitor outside a gurudwara for being drunk, she wasn't even in the premises of the structure. I highly doubt the welcoming religion part of your post. 

7. Everyone talks of 1984, nobody talks of how buses filled with Hindus were burned before it. How temples were desecrated. How Hindus were made to run away overnight from Punjab by a terrorist organisation. Khalistan is an illegitimate demand mired in racial a d religious superiority complex, and has zero claim to fruition in reality.Spot on. This is something that most adults today somehow don't understand. Actions have consequences, same goes for speech.Everybody knows about 1984. This happened too and not a lot of people are aware of it. Quit your whataboutery. If you feel that strongly then make a separate post about 1984.Very good post OP. This is hitherto unknown to the general public. Punjab of late 70s and 80s was a completely different place.‡§ß‡§®‡•ç‡§Ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§¶ ‡§≠‡§æ‡§ä üòä üôè‡§Ü‡§à ‡§≤‡§æ ‡§®‡§Æ‡§∏‡•ç‡§ï‡§æ‡§∞ ‡§¶‡§æ‡§¶‡§æ üòä ‡§¶‡§ø‡§µ‡§æ‡§≥‡•Ä ‡§ö‡•Ä ‡§π‡§æ‡§∞‡•ç‡§¶‡§ø‡§ï ‡§∂‡•Å‡§≠‡•á‡§ö‡•ç‡§õ‡§æGood effort OP.

On that note, read Arun Shourie's 'Worshipping False Gods' once.You went for the jugular with this comment, good one. He's made many such claims, but people keep it hush as questioning him is akin to a sin.Sanatan !=sanctimonious preach on each and every facet of it. Sanatan != Temples controlled by government, many times temple board members aren't even hindu. Firecrackers are bad, that's a fact, but the preach has to be either for everyone or for no one.*tendDamn, sarcasm ne downvotes karwa diyeWell, this is exactly how our complete legal apparatus is structured. Somebody dogwhistles someone and tangentially related entities take action. All the while nobody questions the dogwhistler. Nevertheless, this is a live example of:

a. There's no such thing as karma.
b. Justice isn't possible in this land.They don't have their origins in China decidedly. And this isn't about crackers anyways. This is about people whining about on based on minuscule facts. My comment was an addendum to it as to how anything done by the 'majority' is qowfullt vilified. Case in point would be fasting on navratri etc being not good for the body, patriarchal etc, while Ramzan fasting being beneficial for health.I have the same opinions for Coelho and many others.Artstation.com, Nikhil Mishra's profile. Beautiful digital renditions.Again, sounds good. Doesn't work. Just FYI, I've tried it. You are free to try at your end though.There already are articles talking about diyas as wasting oil, funeral pyres being smoke emanating and many such op-eds.Beautiful OP. The yantra rangoli itself might've taken hours. Again, beautiful.Sounds good, doesn't work. Go to any street pandal all over Maharashtra on April 14th and listen to the language. Now try to use legal means.Yeah, don't do that ever. Unfortunately, current law structure doesn't allow for any legal help for this. However they have sc/St with them. Nevertheless, this is going to increase in coming years. The best way is to slowly find find people who aren't going to abuse you for your caste.I know what your base argument about that is. I am saying even the animals that people eat require food. It's a double cycle of energy production, ergo wasteful. This coming from someone who isn't even vegan. Nevertheless, this rhetoric isn't even warranted in your current post.I don't need to Google this. My farm provides food for many animal husbandry industries. Animals eventually eat whatever is produced by humans and bulk up. That same produce can directly be eaten by humans most of the times. This seems like an argument directly from a Joe Rogan podcast. Just to sustain the massive animal and dairy industry increasing swathes of land are cleared. These will then go to feed animals that will again take up space. Just for example, farmers in Brazil swtiched from their cash crop of sugarcane to soybean so as to provide it as feed to pigs in China. Regarding you other point, the preach about crackers is completely inconsequential when nothing is being done to tackle other reasons, the two major ones being stubble burning and building construction related dusts. These are proven heavy polluters. Scientific studies have shown that crackers doesn't amount to much with respect to pollution.Veganism kills more animals?And? Judiciary let's a murder slide because counsel doesn't show? Moreover, the information here seems contradictory. Why is there a need for a case to be filed for murders? The local investigative agency takes the matter to court after panchnama and establishment of chain of events. Thereafter if someone is apprehended a chargesheet is filed and case proceeds, after that if a lawyer isn't present for on behalf of dead person, a public counsel is provided. Now, let's suppose someone filed s case which can also be done as a third party, why/how will a BJP appointed counsel come in? Won't the responsibility for that lie with the petitioner? See, I am not arguing your point and I personally don't care for politics here. This is complete failure of the system, politiciana are just a part of it. Primary line of safety for people aren't the local politician, rather local bureaucracy. Everyone has failed, accountability needs to be asked from all of them, not just one entity. This needs complete resolution now, not patchwork.Oh yeah, that too.What's judiciary and bureaucracy doing? Granted politicians have failed but this also falls under the purview of other pillars of a supposed democracy. Don't they have a responsibility too here? Or suo moto is reserved only for agenda driven actions? We need to start questioning the other pillars too.Yup, the things that Turks, Mughals and Brits couldn't do have been systematically done by a constitutionally empowered government body.A lot of people don't understand the significance of demography is destiny and TFR.You need two specialists. Gastroenterologist and Psychiatrist, not psychologist. Since you have mentioned gastroenterologist visits before and the situation hasn't abated, a psychiatrist may be able to help. Actually with some digestion related issues, psychiatry medicines work better. Remember, not a psychologist, Psychiatrist. All the best.Post independence TN was the first state to enact HR&CE act. This is the act that empowers constitutionally validated looting of a religious institution belonging to the so called 'majority'. Irony is, such a loot is constitutionally valid. Many temple boards contain non Hindus as board members, same cannot be said true for any so called minority religious institutions.You forgot culturedPost independence TN was the first state to enact HR&CE act. This is the act that empowers constitutionally validated looting of a religious institution belonging to the so called 'majority'. Irony is, such a loot is constitutionally valid. Many temple boards contain non Hindus as board members, same cannot be said true for any so called minority religious institutions.NoYeha man. Is that why there are almost daily tweets of a plethora of people abusing politicians across the sprectrum? Is that why Nupur Sharma's statement caused the judiciary to issue statement on her 'lose tongue setting the country on fire'? Is that why after that statement the tailor lost his life? Is that why Zubair is still out and Manish Kashyap had his bail denied by the SC on flimsy grounds? It's clear that freedom of speech has become selective. But it's not the way you envisage it is. And these are just a few examples.Stealing cattle is legal in which state?Make the judicial system efficient if vigilantism is to be combatted. That's my first comment. People will not believe a system that does nothing for them whatsoever.And? Does it mean they're to be stolen? They are a protected breed under law in many states, is it then okay to break the law and slaughter them? What do you people think so called gourakshaks actually do?Yes I do. My village community takes care of cows all through their lives. No commercial dairy is allowed to setup or sell their products if they don't follow the local rules. Hence many dairies source their milk on a daily basis from local dairy farmers. As I said before, those cows are taken care of for all their lives.Yeah I already know that.Have you seen the absolutely atrocious drivel that the community spews against Hindus any chance they get? If anything the hatred is mutual, you can't just ignore the whole other side of argument and state that only one side is filled with bigots.Of course it's not a democracy, Waqf act exists, so does HR&CE, no UCC, gender differentiated laws exist too. When exactly was the country democratic? If you say  minority rights' are an issue then according to the constitution there really isn't a majority per se. The definition is so broad that everybody is a minority by the virtue of differences. Nevertheless, I seriously want to understand this democracy thing? When was it a democracy?Till actual justice system fails to recognise the seriousness of crimes against cows and actively safeguards them this will continue. Vigilantism happens because the supposed system fails, in Indian context it has failed spectacularly.Irony died a million deaths reading that sentence from the CJI mate.Your comprehension capabilities are beyond my understanding. 

1. I never said don't deal with stubble. Burning as a solution won't work in today's world. That outlook needs to change.

2. People have become much more aware towards pollution in recent years, hence the focus on it. Which isn't misguided even in the slightest

3. There are reports after reports that the air quality issue is majorly contributed to by burning stubble and industrial construction dust. 

4. Being intensionally dense won't make for a solution. 'Farmers' want compensation per hectare basis for not burning stubble, that's daylight blackmail. 

5. Everything was greener before industrial revolution which never happened in India. Everthing was even more green before agricultural revolution when humans lived as foragers. The best way is to revert back to that then, and since that isn't going to happen and this current world requires comprehensive solutions, stubble burning will have to stop. 

6. Stubble can be burned iff (yes that's two ff, it means something else) it's done properly in kilns specifically made for it, not in open air. 

7. If you look at my flair you'll see I belong to the OG producers of rice in this subcontinent, kindly do not state how stubble can be effectively dealt with. Stubble burning might be a practice that evolved in your geography.Spot on.Depends on the friend. The best neutral thing that works all the time is an Amazon gift card. The alternate to lifafas. A newly wed couple may require many things, Amazon gift card will help them in that choice.![gif](giphy|8OPsobKv6ksJojld4X)Where's that gif of Arnold and Carl weathers locking their arms in unison?

Edit:

![gif](giphy|BvsKJXGzqfNPq)Farming in its current form is unsustainable in Punjab, the effects aren't visible right now but will be. By the end of this decade there are going to be serious issues. The climatic model of that state isn't suited for water intensive crops, alarm bells are already ringing with regards to ground water table. A very comprehensive paln of action is required that includes these scientific parameters too. Although this isn't exclusive to Punjab, many other states will face this brewing agricultural crisis.No man, you're being violent against those people, they deserve to be taken care of through direct taxes that a meagre number of people pay in this country. Why even work for prosperity when one can be a perpetual victim. Sorry for the rant.That thought escaped my mind. You're right, that needs to be done. There will definitely be midnight court hearings and matter will be resolved in like days. Heck, they will no longer be annadaataas, they'll be nuisance then. We should also declare other festival and festive affairs as non Hindu, this drivel will then vanish in thin air, like a fart in autumn winds.ISI wants to help India, it's India that causes people to go rogue and wreak havoc on the country. All the while our exceptional neighbor state's agent is so friendly with us. Yay, humanity wins, what's not to like in the plot line? This doesn't happen in real life? Bullywood knows best man, didn't you watch Mai hoona na? With the same plot line without the added ISI spy masala, terrorist is Raghavan who won't let project Milaap happen because he's a disgraced Army officer with an agenda, same with Shaurya. See, it's the officers of IA or other armed forces eho are at fault here. Definitely not bullywood, they can't do anything wrong, like ever. 

Regarding your question OP, the logic is straight forward. Close down factories because they pollute. Everybody can be an actor and can only do acting, the most eco friendly industry in existence. It doesn't matter if India is now a net importer of Copper in increased numbers. 35k metric tons in 2017 to 139k metric tons in 2021. Who even cares, just close down the factories. The movie is right, you shouldn't question it.Freedom of speech is selective, also he's cleverly dodged using actual words. Not that even if he uses actual words, our legal apparatus will do anything. They did acquit junior Owaisi, stating that the statement was ambiguous, the statement that clearly insinuates violence. But yeah, a woman's 'lose tongue set the country on fire' and Manish Kashyap deserved to have his bail plea rejected and subsequently languish in jails for asking questions, because well, that's hate speech according to exceptional standards of our country.He's a chicken shop owner.Very beautiful pics OP.It's about the sanctimonious preach. Cracker usage was withering away and the industry was dying it's natural death. There's a rhythm to these things. SC started with pontifications and singling out only one reason for pollution, rather than a comprehensive approach towards a very serious problem. Now that crackers have been outright banned thousands of families in Sivakasi find themselves without a means to earn money, 'farmers' get away with burning stubble, governments get away with inaction towards the problem in its entirety. You want to preach, make it proper and follow it through by taking actions.Complete capacity overhaul of total judicial system. Right from lower courts to the apex. They already have the authority to arm twist any government they want to. If you disagree with that, this conversation ends here. This is just the start though, I have many other gripes with Indian jurisprudence in general. But that's another altogether.Read my comment history then. The comment your first replied to was meant to be sarcastic.Yup, accountability is the agenda. Stop with the preach and start with the actions, plain and simple. Politicians will come and go the rest two 'pillars' of this supposed democracy are overdue for a complete overhaul.Kissing whose ass? Judiciary?I have every reason to, you keep scapegoating everyone else except the judiciary. Almighty courts can rebuke the parliament for not hiring judges. Almighty courts can also strike down the ridiculous collegium system. I didn't even include that ridiculous system in this conversation. Judiciary trashed NJAC bill too on incoherent grounds.I honestly don't know what you are talking about. I can only answer one thing, agrarian doesn't mean they can create hitherto pollution with blatant disregard to everyone else.Pontificating after retirement males no sense except for just talking markers in speeches. They had the power to do so while working. That's the point I am making. Seriously? Digest it? Sure then don't crib when vigilante justice happens and when corruption surmounts. Also, say this to the lacs of undertrials awaiting their dates, lacs others facing fake allegations; clearing which takes better part of a decade. Heck, a person was imprisoned for 2 decades for a crime he didn't commit, and such cases aren't very few, they're way too common. Also, go and state that digest part to people who die waiting for justice, some even die waiting for dates. Oh, lastly I won't compare judicial working of this country with any other country when taking care of a traffic violation summons sometimes takes upto 2-3 months.It's a catch 22, until the institution takes responsibility it won't improve and until it improves such statements will keep coming. And sorry I will have to disagree with the 'them being human' drivel. They place themselves at upper echelons of everything when it comes to the constitution, they need to justify that by acting in far higher self regard and self awareness. Same goes for bureaucrats too. People belonging to both these institutions in our country think of themselves to be several notches above the common public, which honestly they are. They need to behave accordingly.Never said they were on holidays. The argument of them being unable to hire more and the nation being resource restrained all the while we have judges reitiring and then pontificating that so many cases are pending is hypocrisy to say the least. I have had my fair of brush with mighty judiciary of this country and am speaking from experience. The judicial system is up for an overhaul, and yet they keep on thwarting any kind of reform. Sitting CJI goes to America and feigns in front of their citizens as to how they are the only non partisan institution of the country, ironically US judiciary has oversight to contain it's overreach. We have judges on all levels giving absurd statements. What will studying up on functionality of it all achieve here exactly? Is it pitch perfect? No, but can it be improved? Definitely yes. Are strong efforts being put in that direction? I don't see any.Kissing or kicking?Politicians can be removed from their power positions. Judiciary has zero oversight and from their judgements it's quite probable that they don't even understand the pulse of the people. I will give you one more exhibit, a sitting judge remarked on domestic violence from a wife on her husband to consider it as godess's offering. Granted that there are no laws to protect men is a flaw of  the parliamentarians (I don't believe in that excuse anyways, as SC recently siad that they can make and break laws if it fancies them, nevertheless that's what people think so be it). But those words were the judge's own. No law forced him to be this obtuse. You may believe that they come from the same society, I don't. Many HC and SC judges don't come from regular backgrounds, moreover many of them don't even have any connection with regular people. The way they preach of being a special class of people, I personally don't feel like they belong of the society that I am part of, i.e. the regular people.Visit a district court once, you'll see ke koi hi Seema nahi hai inke liye. Pehle tumko stamp paper wala gadha banayega, fir stamp paper pe matter type karne waala typist. Fir arji file karne jaoge wahan. Fir hearing hogi ke maamla court mein jaana hai ke nahi, sarkari vakeel hai tumhara to uske upar itne case hai ke jaane hi do. Private vakeel karne jaoge per hours charge lagayega, haisiyat ho to kar sakte ho vakeel. Chalo itna sab karke maamla phoncha court mein saamne waali party court mein date ke din absent rahegi to taarikh aage badhte rahegi. Agar kisi janani ne case Kiya hai to usko bola bhi nahi jaayega ke aao court mein. Khapte khapte fir jab tumhari sehenshakti khatam ho jaayegi agar possible hua to out of court settlement hi try karoge fir realise hoga, pehle hi kar lete ye. 'Delhi ka darinda Sarabjit' case mein saamne waali naari kitni hi hearings mein se ek mein bhi nahi aayi fir bhi case khatam karne mein almost 8 saal lag gaye. Baijjat bari hua hai. Bolo aa gayi 'ijjat' waapas? Kitne news houses ne, media ne, us ladki ne maafi maang li?Nah, nobody can bother overlords, see they have to research everything. Nobody else does that, research. They are thinkers, philosophers, keepers of spirit of the nation, they have heavy responsibility on their shoulders. Nobody else has responsibilities man.In some places you'll get the mercy of 3-4 months, in many other locations it's definitely as high as previously mentioned. In some locations they may also ask you to furnish proof of your job and earning through offer letter documents or pay slip.That will break the hegemony and overlords won't like that. Nor will the keepers of said overlords.Then hire extra hands, justice delayed is justice denied, pretty simple. The common man is bored by the preach it's time for overlords to actually practice the same preach and clear incompetencies in their own system. Every system requires constant evaluation, addition, research and thinking and yet this key institution is absolutely lacking in its capacity. Even after thorough research there have been many oddball statements from SC judges, an exhibit would be 'setting fire to the nation through lose tongue'.The most absurd thing is deposit amount of 6-12 months' rent.Nobody should say anything to annadaataas. They give us food, this is nutritious air in production.You'd also see guys from other regions band up and use the disgusting acronym used to club those states together. There's also the usage of cowbelt and what not.We can keep questioning, the keepers of it won't heed. Don't you remember, SC judges too annadaataa's children.Why? No international news coverage on universal brotherhood of Pakistan?You are using troll.in taking it's source from dawn, a Pakistan based news agency as your crutch? Do better.There's no mention of lower caste, there's mention of other caste. There's a difference between the two.This is a print media story in its initial stages. There's nothing to opine from general population perspective. She has a legal provision for such, let the court establish truth, whatever it may be.If there's merit in the allegations then this needs to be investigated.We all sit on the floor during dinner timeThere are special vacation benches for those days. Nevertheless, all holidays will be cancelled in a jiffy if urgent hearing is necessary for anti-social elements. You see, 'justice' is very peculiar about its privileged lot. Also, even if self entitled black coats don't take holidays, their case load will almost remain the same. On their working days they will pontificate and preach, on off days many go to foreign countries to feign how they're the only institution that is independent and how common people don't get how tough their work environment is.Such thousand word pictures also have emerged from India Mr. David. Forgot the picture of vulture waiting for kid to die? Noakhali riots aftermath? It's ironic how thousand words pictures are also topical, and even in that, a newspaper of this country couldn't bring it to fore, rather found the napalm girl from many decades ago. Nevertheless, the current topic that has invoked this weirdly worded article with very specific leanings and pontifications. Again strangely forgetful of such picture coming out of India and being ignored by national and international media in eerie cohesion. This time around too there were a thousand word pictures from the very first day, forgot the naked girl being spat on from the day of invasion? The elderly women being shot point blank? Charred bodies amidst heap of mangled buildings. People saw all of that at the start and somewhere subconsciously decided that the perps deserve no mercy. Your strangely worded article tries to monkey balance even the incident that you're trying to use as a springboard for eponymous past of such pictures, really strange.Par commandments mein baaki sab allowed hai re. Sirf crackers allowed nahi hai.I am not defending firecrackers, I am stating inaction against other contributors. Plain and simple. This conversation is now at a stalemate from my end. Being sympathetic has nothing to do with inaction and actually tackling the problem in its absolute entirety. Nevertheless, I personally don't care if you think I lack sympathy. I live in a society hence my demand to completely tackle the issue in a comprehensive way rather than bellyaching and preaching others.You included religion in your reply, I just asked you to be secular in your blame shift and reciprocative actions against other causes too. A lot of things can be done at individual levels for other facets of this issue too. Stop using private vehicles, use public transport. Do not partake in merry rides in your IC engine based personal vehicles. Heck, ev is quite lucrative currently. Regulatory authorities can be chided and subsequently coerced into doing something about stubble burning. Littering is a major issue in every festival regardless of religion. You started your tirade by invoking 'majority' community's sentiments.Okay, let's say from Narak chaturdashi to Tulsi Vivah, 5 important days. Does that make a dent into other contributions? And is the intensity of cracker bursting the  same on all days? Just because I exclusively did not say it doesn't mean aye to firecrackers. My reply was towards your pontification in original reply. I personally never have burst any firecrackers, just have observed people. Nor have I ever asked anybody to purchase it foe any occasion. But that's irrelevant in this conversation, hence I kept emotions aside. You've made another personal comment of me lacking sympathy, first that's not the case, second that's irrelevant. If you have to make a point make it without involving personal tactics. My first reply was in addendum to what you stated, not against it. Read it once again if you're confused.Are you a kid? If you are then this conversation ends right here. But if you're not, I clearly stated that singling out one thing that happens for one day per annum and not tackling the far bigger causes is why people get irritated. You've added personal problem and useless chiding in your replies I don't understand the necessity for it, nor did I condone bursting firecrackers. I personally have enjoyed Nagaoka fireworks festival, Tenjin Matsuri and Edogawa fireworks festival. Search them on YT and observe the age groups of people present there.I cannot give a logical take to a personal issue. Anything I say will be construed negatively. Nevertheless, current AQI of NCR is horrible with Deepawali a comfortable 9 days away. Preach away.It's the preach that's irksome. People need to control that first and foremost. Cracker industry in India has always been rudimentary and was dying a natural death for many years. SC butted it's head into this and eventually ignored every evidence just to flex their intellectual muscle on a an event that happens for a single day or at most 5 days per year. They were presented with evidence from actual scientists and yet decided to take the decision that would give them the absolute minimum of backlash. Stop with the preach and this will eventually die down plain and simple. Also, just fyi there are enough articles preaching about how sweets are bad in Diwali and cakes are good in late December, how oil lamps are bad for the environment and a waste of resources, how every 'majority' festival is actually misogynistic as women 'slave' in the kitchen for everyone else. It's a slippery slope on its way to doom. It's not apparent now, will be very clear by the end of this decade.Blaming a singular facet all the time, everytime is tiresome. Delhi's smog issue is mainly because of parali burning and Diesel vehicles, but there's no concrete action for these majority contributors. Whatever sporadic steps have been taken have been abjectly ineffective. Be secular in your blame shifting too.Sarcasm hai commentThen why the preach from a singular lens? It's a multi pronged problem. The festival happens once a year, once. Why are other reasons to be given a lax treatment?Don't forget monetary burden needed for all this.So does burning parli, there's no Diwali right now and still NCR is choked. Tackle the problem in its entirety and don't keep on shifting the blame to a singular source and then keep wallowing in self loathe.Bas ab. You've tried, ye divide hamesha rahega.Exceptionally useless response.It's actually an integral part, Bali that is. But it can definitely be replaced with vegetables depending upon the deity. For some ash gourd is preferred. While choosing an animal all proper rules are to be followed, honestly very few places do it in tandem with rules now. I am saying this as a shakta.Random people cut grown buffaloes on roads at many places in the country. Yt is your friend for sources. You'll find abandoned innards and carcasses in many city streets. Just because your local area does have that issue doesn't mean it doesn't happen anywhere else too.And? There are no crackers in sight, yet NCR is currently choked with smog. How far is this virtue signalling and subsequent blame shifting relevant really? Firecrackers employed at least 2000 families in Sivakasi, did anybody create alternatives for them before outright taking away their livelihoods overnight? Was there a gradual shift to reduction provided? Why haven't parali burners been rebuked by anybody, viz. Judiciary, polity or bureaucracy?Koi problem nahi hai, load mat le.Yup, it's actually quite easy to blame the priests for everything that happens as there's never going to be a retaliation from their side. The only way for them to earn their living is through these things. But them earning is considered sinful for some reason.All of your responses on this post are appreciated. The Doha doesn't fit and you've properly painted a picture of karmkand based people's issues in current world. The drivel against them all the while ignoring flaws in self is hypocrisy to say the least.DW, Al jaljeera, BBC and many others are directly funded by their governments. And if you don't find BBC factoid based, there's something seriously wrong with your comprehension. British balderdash corporation has been known of obfuscate facts, twist words, present factoids in their reporting. Many individuals over the years have stated this. They tried to actively protect Jimmy Saville, Balen reports, Seimens outsourcing, Dennis Avey claims, 2010 Bob Geldof issue. The list will be endless. Nevertheless [here's an example of trying to out words in mouth by a BBC person.](https://youtu.be/WC9JlG-ZXX0?si=omuYKegBiqmXLwAn)Arey bas na ab. Wo tujhe gol ghuma raha hai, tu unnecessary indulge kar raha hai.Actually no mate, politicians are only a single facet of the issue. Remember, SC junked IITD scientific study on causes of such dastardly air quality and squarely blamed it all on firecrackers. Annadaataas weren't called into question, same with the arrogant protests that took north  India's highways hostage. Heck even Justin Trudeau's Canada isn't this liberal. They blocked protesting truckers' bank accounts and forcefully ended the so called protests that had created a log jam of supplies.Annadaataas ko koi kuch nahi bolega, sab patakhon ki galti hai, itni galti ke yahan bina phate hi dhuan dhuan kar  diya hai. A farmer is never wrong, wo anaj ke badle dhuan dene ka adhikar rakhta hai. Mausam, hawaon aur pahadon ki galti bhi hai yahan, but not the farmer.

Net carbon neutrality in electricity production is achievable.BalderdashThat's true too.Spot on.Don't Ambedkar's 22 vows that he used in Deeksha bhumi contain tenets against consumption of meat? Do these people even follow their own ideological leader's thinking?

1. 11th vow talks about noble eightfold path. 4th one in eight fold talks about no killing. 5th one; right livelihood, no trading in living beings and meat among other things.

2. 13th vow states maitri for all living beings and protecting them. 

3. 18th vow talks of both the above points.

4. 17th talks of not taking intoxicating drinks, taken from 5 precepts; those again begin with not harming any living being.Ete sarcastic rakhichi comment ra tone.

Which honestly is partly our fault for not being assertive. Nevertheless, nice one OP.YupAbey ![img](emote|t5_3d4x4|20020)See people this is a classic example of what is called as bait. The speaker here fails to acknowledge that Hindi actually has something called ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ that helps in proper ‡§â‡§ö‡•ç‡§ö‡§æ‡§∞‡§£. Due to ‡§Æ‡§æ‡§§‡•ç‡§∞‡§æ it's quite easy to read and speak. However, but and put aren't spoken the way it's read. Same with champagne, same with will and the letter w,  the examples are endless. The child in this add is still learning and will be much more adept later. But languages such as English will always depend on how much one speaks it on a daily basis as there's no coherence between how it's written and how it's spoken, even with well defined grammatical rules.Stop listening to drivel from 'rich people'. Their world experiences are too far different from normal peasants. Here he's saying things and on the other side dating some bullywood chick. No coherence between his words and actions, why even care.Good post OPAptly put.They tried with NJAC bill in the first term. SC judges struck it down.I agree, current case would've been avoided with complete implementation of Kavach. It still cannot detect collision with the tail end of a train, as was the case with previous incident.I don't know if you're being intentionally dense, the original comment had erroneous usage of kavach system mentioned, hence I made a corrective statement, that's it. My thoughts about the whole thing from a moral, authoritative and technical standpoint are not subject to current conversation.I am talking about utility of kavach system and only that. Nothing else.Fair points, especially in the last four paragraphs.Very good post OP.Kavach is for protection from head on collision. The incident from six months ago wasn't a head on collision. It uses signal passing in danger to deploy emergency brakes, not applicable to earlier incident.If 'claims' are to be normalised in accordance to population, why the tag of 'minority' then?Billionaire industrialists taking 'inspiration' from literal PM of a population of 1.4 billion and then sermonizing regular people all the while paying peanuts is a different level of delusion altogether. PM isn't preaching anybody about work hours. If billionaire babus feel it so much then they can do two things to facilitate the nonsense that they've spewed, first would be to increase salaries across the board, second would be to officially allow moonlighting. Or else stop with the virtue signalling. People are miserable in their corporate jobs and find a veritable escape outside it in some way or another. Irrespective of what anybody may think, most people aren't going to escape this rut, let them survive and eventually fade away.The joke maybe ignorant and inconsequential. The act of breaking it in jest isn't inconsequential. Definitely ignorant though.I see that situation developing somewhere around 2030s. Oil for energy will eventually be replaced, but oil also is ever present in manufacturing almost everything else, especially anything plastic based. Although, Qatar is based on LNG exports, that can actually be tackled quite successfully. But any kind of aggressive maneuvering will still be a challenge due to the high number of expats.The most important facet in all of this, brilliant comment.Don't forget state home minister changing suits during the ordeal. Also the book release later attended by dignitaries like Mahesh Bhatt.One person has hilariously exclaimed in this comment section that people who don't understand government work paradigm should shut up.People are not being paid in accordance to the work they put in. Modern slavery is a thing exactly because of that. Such hours are already being put in by bank employees, IT employees, state transport employees, loco pilots etc. But they never get properly paid. There's such a thing as life away from work, most work cultures are toxic and restrictive. OP, you have a penchant to work incessantly that's your prerogative. Other people have different priorities. Moreover, billionaires preaching about work is hilarious to say the least.First it was Naxalism, then duplicitous conversions. Then there's constant attack from 'intellectual' class on practices. Then there's almost non-existent development outside of capital city that causes people from other areas to either leave or fight for resources. Then there's self righteous groups that don't want the state to 'develop' it's natural resources.Yup, you've put it quite succinctly. The thing is, one can just do their job, job as in not profession. Job as in duty, but that duty itself is many fold. One also has duties to be done onto oneself too. Formost being, doing things that need doing and not dwelling on results. Results will always be expected and there will always be emotions intertwined with them. Either positive or negative. That's how the real world will always work. Nevertheless, one's duty also lies in the fact that they eventually learn their lesson and learn to forgive themselves, move on. Try to get closure. It's this pursuit that matters, that's why duty is supposed to be paramount. Most of the times, people just react to stimuli presented to them. We have a right to reaction, not the stimuli itself. 

Your last paragraph suggests you've gone through some trauma. I sincerely hope you get solace, and subsequent closure about it. All the best mate.I come from an area of extremely problematic situations. People of your thinking and attitude caused and still are causing even more problems for people over there. Keep your preachy non-violence incoherence to yourself.There's actually no way to gain leverage against them, especially Qatar.You can read this comment section.Proper take on the issue.Arey aise kaise tu violently bol raha hai. Patthar pheka na tere pe usko zendu ka flower samajhne ka. Prem varsha hor rahi re pagle tere upar. Bheegi billi Banna hi Satya hai. Violence koi tere par kare, to karne de re, tu soch bhi mat violence karne ka. Us soch ki atmaglani bohot jyada ho jaayegi re, OP jaise logon ko shield bana ke use kar re.Interesting. So OP, just because you live in a bubble and never face consequences of your complacency, you get to preach and project it on others? Different people have different realities. Bending over backwards in obeisance to nonsense isn't what sanatan entails either. It's your prerogative to do so, do not preach others to follow that path. There's a reason HR&CE, WAQF, no UCC and many other social issues exist. This lame reasoning, that you presented without shatrubodh facilitates the existence of those issues. Demanding things and actions doesn't directly mean violence. And if you are so hell bent on preaching non violence, start with people like the ones who slit the throat of that tailor.Escalate this. They probably forgot your luggage in holding area. Use Twitter, tag DGCA, Air India authorities. Also write mails to their upper echelons, use the air tag info you have available at hand.Multi pronged approach. Proper legal structure to fight cases, just like the Jain brothers did. Street veto, as that is the only thing our 'intellectual' class understands. Shunning of ideologues that aim at ridiculing us. Academia needs to acknowledge that Hinduphobia and Hindumisia are real. Most importantly, businesses need to shun people with open blatant biases. Harvard 'intellectual' class got their due when they started spewing nonsense against Jews. The student orgs started withdrawing their support because their future prospective jobs were are stake. Can't expect desi businesses to have that kind of spine. There's a clear difference between free speech and hate speech. SC, academia, 'intellectual' class; everybody is abusing it to mount attacks on the so called majority. The 'majority' now needs to take stock of this and reject all such people and agendas.Good for you and your semantics. Next time, be polite if you want an actual polite response. Don't expect decent replies when you start a conversation with condescention.You're the one with the smug reply. My reply is a mirror of yours. Also, I have already stated what I mean. In case your dunce head can't comprehend it I will give an addendum. I believe in karm as duty, not like karmic retribution, what goes around comes back around. It's a cope that people create for themselves to normalize whatever misfortunes befall them. That's good for them, I personally don't believe in it.Don't care what you think. I have clearly differentiated what I mean by the words.Only government action isn't going to achieve anything. There's also needs to be bureaucratic and judical accountability.Define karma. I understand karm, if you are talking about karmic retribution then a resounding and unequivocal no. Meaning what goes around comes back around may or may not happen. No use dwelling on it. Just like justice, this is a very abstract concept.What does this do on the ground though? We, the Indian 'majority' have amnesia when it comes to such mass murders. Heck we don't even talk about things that happened in just the past 70 odd years.Last best time was 1947, next best is right now. One should get all support to live their ideologies in land of their dreams.What is a majority? Can you give a constitutional definition? Define dharm. Also, while you are at it, this is the same country where HR&CE exists, WAQF exists, there's no UCC and our very friendly neighborhood nations' demographic make up represents their true spirit of secularism. Also, protection of 'minority' doesn't mean subduing the 'majority'. Moreover, if one goes by the constitutional definition of 'minority', there can actually be no majority in this country, everybody is a minority. Your drivel is quite shallow, do better. Preamble is supposed to reflect the conscience of people, not the other way around.Itna sach nahi bolna tha.Follow your advice from original comment, don't take it seriously.Nobody should take him seriously.Knowledge!=real world experience. Xiaoping's educational bifurcation is a very vague term to use and call someone socialist. There wasn't even a hint of socialist drivel in the original comment.Yup, the enjoyment of any festival comes after the penance for it. It seems everyone just forgets that part. Bhakti is gone, so is penance, sole focus is on merriment and when someone inadvertently objects people take offense.Did I say blood sacrifice shouldn't be done? Read the comment once again.I am very well aware of that. The post title is misleading, so is the author of the article. All of this is an exercise in creating very easy differential fault lines within communities.Then add it in yout post footnote. You fired a salvo based on an article and then have made many comments in the post too. I understand the sub rule of not manipulating the title, yet you can always add a footnote, you didn't because you wanted a certain projection.

Edit: there's a difference between beef and buff, do many people don't understand the difference and try to create problems for others; yes. Is beef not considered right for consumption of a practicing Hindu; unequivocally yes. Is buffalo allowed, yes. Is the animal sacrificed by using proper ritualistic practices as prescribed under rules of sacrifice; almost never. There's a difference between maams as a sacrificial offering and maaams bhakshan, none of the scriptures advice the latter.Very few pandals do it. The ones which are associated with actual shaktipeethas do it and some others. Such pandals are scattered over Bengal, Odisha, Jharkhand, Chattisgarh, Assam and many other states.I am very well aware of what panch makar entails, I said maams bhakshan, not maams as sacrificial offering. The latter is sacrosanct. First one isn't and is not prescribed. A pandal isn't following any of it.1. Your post heading says at Puja pandal, not outside. Don't play the semantics game.
2. You envisaged that the people taking offense are talibanising, you are doing the same by not actually understanding what the rules are and by passing generalizations. 
3. I already said in my opening argument that there are differences between inside and during.Panchmakar rules do not prescribe maams bhakshan. Moreover, the pandal isn't following any of it.Eating 'during' and eating 'inside' are two different facets. Was the animal prepared under tantrokt rules? Was the animal selected under tantrokt rules? Was the animal sacrificed under trantokt rules? Is pandal a sacrificial ground? All different questions, just like other sects generalize and miss nuances, you too have done the same. Also, I am not a vaishnav.Thank you for saying this. People don't want to accept this simple baseline difference.I am a practicing shakta and this 'tradition' of eating mutton in pandals is asura pravritti. That's the straight version. There's no 'abrahamisation' here and many others have pointed out. Pandal isn't a sacrificial ground, the animals haven't been slaughtered under trantokt rules, the animal hasn't also been prepared in accordance to the prescribed rules.That's tough.Did the place atleast have some kind of anti skid mats?Sure, also just FYI that line you presented the ahimsa one; does not exist in any smriti or Shruti in that exact form. The actual shlok has been bent to mean something that isn't even the purpose of what was written.Bending over backwards in obeisance towards people who clearly want to harm you. And then subsequently projecting this moronic propensity of self sacrifice upon others. Then cherry topping it with the drivel that everybody is just being an 'extremist', isn't what Hinduism entails in any way whatsoever. Also, Muslims are second majority, minority by Indian constitution's definition is so vague that the country actually cannot have a so called 'majority'.Kudos to you mate. Also, apprecition for the hard work. Working in stores in laborious, sometimes dangerous too.Thank you. There's one thing though, I'd say they are being ignorant in this case. They being the upper management in such chains. The individual franchise owners just follow orders. However that's only specific to this particular case, many other times, yes the disregard is very blatant and disrespectful. We just go silent and don't say anything at all. It's always very important to properly read labels, especially in other countries as they don't have the colored dot based marking system like India. The best example of this would be that many cheeses with EU origin are animal rennet based. Many Indians have no clue how animal rennet is procured, that it is banned in India (any cheese made in India uses microbial rennet) and almost all cheeses use it. Same with desserts like pana cotta, that use gelatin to achieve the jiggly texture. Outside India, Gelatin is overwhelmingly bovine based, sometimes fish based.It seems people are not aware of this boycott thing. Posters like this have rebounded in prominence since the recent conflict. However this boycott agenda has been an undercurrent for many decades now. If you visit any old city areas of say Bhopal, Aurangabad (Maharashtra) etc. you'll find these posters. The brands listed are said to be owned and operated by Jews and hence need to be boycotted.That's the best policy.You can always ask. All food chains/hotels/restaurants will have to divulge the truth. The best way is to ask the staff rather than the management. Be polite when you ask it.Very good post OP. I too have personally let many people know of this issue. Again, thank you.Mote jana nahi MLA Babu kon kahitile, news link achi ki?Where's fascism here? And in comparison with what historical context/polity/action is it intense?It's a propaganda movie made with the intention to show that sometimes army officers go overboard but secularism prevails. The movie itself is a blatant ripoff of Tom Cruise starrer, 'A few good men'. The dialogue itself in the movie's context is overly negative, however the 'noble' intentions of movie makers backfired on them.Figures presented in response to LS question 2849, by ministry of defence on 11th March 2020 TN was at 23/million population and Gujarat at 16/million population based on figures from recruitment numbers of 2017-2019. Gujarat has a population of ~6.27 crores, which means about 1003 in absolute numbers. TN is at 7.21 crores so this number is at 1656. Nepal numbers are at 63/million, a total of 1890 given that their population is at 3 crores. Kindly present the source of your figures and historical data used. Also, is there is any particular aim at using Gujarat here? With regards to total numbers outside of recruitment i.e. people who already are in active service, as a response to LS question no. 611 unstarred, 2019; Officer rank inventory isn't maintained in statewise manner. However for JCOs and ORs, i.e Junior commissioned officer and Other ranks, TN is at 5345 JCO, 49441 for OR (army), GJ is at 766 JCO, 22989 for OR. For Navy: 616 JCO, 789 OR; GJ 74 JCO, 443 OR. For Air Force: TN 644 JCO, 1343 OR; GJ 145 JCO 1032 OR. In total figures for tri-services, TN is at 58,178 for JCO and OR, GJ is at 25,389 for the same. Given the population of both states, sure TN is above but one also needs to take into consideration that many military facilities, complexes and centres are present in TN and not so many in Gujarat. Better exposure to opportunities makes people go for the said opportunities.They also don't care until it's alphabet people, global leftists, basically anybody that doesn't like culture, traditional values and sociology of religions. Except for one religion.The coincidence is beautiful here. As I said, I have had level headed and good interactions with people from there. It's simply because they are in touch with whatever happened. And I do agree with people not talking about that trauma. It's painful.Okay, good for you. I don't see those 'alienated' ones on reddit comment sections. Whenever and wherever I see them in real life they have my unequivocal support.The comment does not mean what you think it means, however the way it is worded is confusing.We still have a servitude based approach towards foreign countries even after gaining their citizenship. The speaker does not understand what colonialism means.I am from Odisha, I have grown up with them being my neighbours, literally and figuratively too. The looking down part is very common. Personal experience or otherwise. 1946 is just an example, bhadraloke and bhadraloke adjacent deny any violence whatsoever. Actually the best Bengali natives that I have interacted with are either from erstwhile Chittagong region or the ones who had to run away from the state due to violence being unleashed on them.Bruh, noice.There's a very big stray dog problem in Odisha. As the night barges in and dawn cracks on many of these chase people. Many 'dog lovers' feed them cheap sugary glucose biscuits and they now have that expectation from everybody. Many children are attacked by strays too. OP you're generalizing your statement in the post footnotes based on very localised experiences. This isn't the reality for many people.This is a very crucial point that many people miss. Very good take.She's of foreign origin though. Etiquettes are only viable until your opposition takes cognizance of it.Rest of India thinks so because many people from that state vociferously do 2 things:

1. Boast of bygone eras of glory and look down upon everybody else.
2. Vehemently deny their own history viz. Noakhali, 1946 Calcutta killings, riots during processions being done by 'majority' community. The list is endless, and yet they will form a tirade against everybody stating that, 'Bengali culture is different'.

Well it certainly is different when a culture doesn't acknowledge whatever has happened, heck it completely ignores it. Rather than taking lessons from it.So, in another such post many extra curricular secular people stated that hinduism isn't fragile. They also stated that this is artistic expression, as there's a smaller idol that is actually worshipped as the form of primordial godess. Many of those extracurricular seculars are from erstwhile great eastern states. Maybe all of above state copes are okay when it comes to idols. Azaan has a very specific meaning, purpose and timing of recitation. Playing it at a pandal isn't justifiable in any way.A sane comment.You've got proof of that? Seriously, you're accusing people with blatant arrogance. If you've got proof present it to the court or go to the UN. Because if you've got proof and you're doing nothing then you're doing a disservice and if you've got no proof then you're using a lie as a baseline for a scenario that makes no sense.How the goddess looks, acts and what she wears are all very clearly mentioned. None of it depicts her this way.Bending over backwards isn't accomodation or ahimsa or whatever.I am not talking about prevalence, I am talking about legality of it.Reel projection of showing an enemy state to earn moolah is different from actually thumka lagaoing in 'Dawood bha's' functions. Moreover, there are many depictions of unnecessary bonhomie through cross border love, and affections between agencies and people. Individuals shown to be in love is understandable, spy agencies working together, terrorists like 'Raghavan' waging war against the state doesn't even have an iota of truth to it. Importing 'talent' from an exceptionally friendly nation also does not make much sense outside of bullywood again.

This is a country of more than 1 billion, there are many unique talents available here. The exceptionally friendly neighborhood country isn't providing some very special class of talent. For that matter I personally don't believe there's much onus on 'talent' on bullywood but that's a different story altogether.Bullywood bends down in obeisance to Pakistan.Hehe, people throw that word around wantonly these days.I made a mistake. I didn't mean 5th, I meant 13th point. Shot myself in the foot, as 5th is actually one of my highest priorities. Laws have to be gender neutral, period.We are bound to be welfare state, our constitution wills it. Welfare states will always have socialist policies. Those aren't inherently bad as you said.13th won't work. Youth loves uncouth rebellion without causes. Better way is to promote our own culture and expose western cultural, historical dogmas.Tyrion in the court intensifies.4, 5, 6 are already in myriad stages of happening through schemes and institutions. The caveat with 4 being state highways and city roads that come under purview pf state governments not being properly planned and bulit.

3 is impractical, mentorship programs being introduced after 15+ years of service is a far better approach. Government babus being employed and overpaid while also taking up places meant for youth wouldn't be proper.  Unfortunately, many babus don't have any relevant transferable skills, especially in administrative cadre.1. Judicial reforms. This country's laws need to be in lockstep with its potential. Current snail pace judiciary keeps the situational auroboros ongoing, viz. people with potential get so distraught by slow paced reforms, they eventually start self destructing. 


2. Waste management at all levels and across all categories. Green energy initiatives. Everything else has some effective baseline efforts ongoing. This facet is however severely lacking.


3. Free religious structures from government control.

4. Effectively handling refugees being wantonly settled into areas where their demography doesn't fit. Proper documentation of refugees and deporting miscreants.Funny how by yt standards this isn't hate and won't be taken down.Polygamy is allowed in India for the second majority (religion wise).She's expressive and a bit of a wild card. People don't like wild cards in general.That's the point. Judiciary juxtaposes their vehement authority when it comes to so called majority religious practices. Denial of such petitions is just tucking their tails in their hind legs or at the very least playing passing the parcel. Also, SC is on record stating that they can make and break laws. They already do the latter through abrogations.Both people used their liberties, this is a non issue. Someone wanted to be anti, someone else upped the ante and gave them a clap back. Liberties in action.*simp for anything.Ye kya chirkut comment hai.Navami will end today evening, the celebration maybe tomorrow. Dashami starts from today evening, after the next hour.OP, you'll face the ire of 'dog lovers' now. However true your points maybe.Ah, that's really sad to read.Yup, it's easy to state overexertion and sweep the whole thing aside. Plaque formation takes many years to reach above 70%.Why does vrat ka khana havebaby cheese in the first place though?Spot on.Kya karein, saral shabdon mein kisiko kuch sunna samajhna hai nahi. Aur angrez chale Gaye angrezi virasat mein de gaya apne logon ko. Isliye jitni achchi angrezi utna wajan.Sure, whatever floats your boat.And my comment is relevant to the tirade presented by you of Hindus being 'intolerant'. Hindus have been tolerant par excellence, hence the dubious situation as I presented in my first comment.Just like the point you made.I won't be using the word threatened here. The context can very easily be misconstrued into undue aggression from majority community. This is constriction of individual liberty under the garb of 'hurting religious sentiments'. Case in point would be 'ugra Hanuman' stickers from some years ago.Achchi soch hai, isliye hi HR&CE, HMA, rejection of petition for hearing KP issue, no UCC, jaisi baatein hoti rehti hai,  Aise hi rehna chahiye hamesha, ek gaal pe tamacha pade to baaki ke 3 gaal bhi saamne kar dene chahiye. Sahi raah par hain aap. Please lead us from the front by being extremely tolerant.In some issues we are not Indians and regional identity is supreme. In some other issues where the country's official stance is neutral, but in support of victims of gun toting, mass murdering, raping, pillaging glider athletes suddenly it's 'we Indians'. Something seems shady here. Also, the flag is Italian.Trust me bro ki parakashtha maar rahe ho tum. Agar Aisa kuch tha politely bhi bola ja sakta shikshika dwara aur uske baad Jo stage par follow through karne gayi thi Sharma ji madam wo bhi ye bol sakti thi. Aisa kuch kisine koi indication nahi Diya hai.Sorry what? How exactly? This is reactionary, kids greeted she chided, she faced music in a non violent way. How exactly do you equate the two? At least compare situations before blatantly pontificating and subsequently drawing undue comparisons.Because Hindus have an undue bonhomie with people who subvert them from their own practices. Feigning ignorance about our own traditions and roots of said traditions is quite normal.They don't fear Hindus. This is power projection. What exactly are Hindus going to do here? Judiciary shuns us, politicians do, educators heckle us for simply using jsr, bureaucracy caters to ghettos that aren't hindu, viz. immigrant colonies in Delhi, WB and many other places. Heck, people are being openly hinduphobic each and every day, where's the judicial respite even? What fear are you talking about? STSJ caused a tailor to lose his life, the act was recorded on video, have the perps been sentenced? This is just one of the instances. Heck in the events that have happened in the last 10 days, even anti-Semitism is on open display in the country, where's the recourse, fear or whatever? There's no element of fear here.Yeah that's quite possible too.I did that many years ago, then I realised theu algorithm was really bad at suggestions. Earlier they did offer some unique options. Not anymore though.Yeah, that's true.Gemsofbollywood has brought many of these tropes to the surface for people to crealy see. That's one of the reason so many people from the industry attack them vehemently.It's never that simple. Everybody joins the service knowing what they will get paid. Loyalty isn't a function of money, it's may seem so at the surface. But it isn't.Police department has many many many things 'tarnishing' their image that should take priority over this. First would be improper traning in handling evidence and subsequent chain of custody that leads to acquittal of suspects.All sm platforms are low brain, including this one. Actually this one might be worse as everyone thinks that they are intellectuals here.Chilli is expensive they ate goat turd.Good post OP.He's written dialogues and stories for 100s of movies. Him and his ilk of 'writers' created the trope of chor baniya, zaalim thakur, tharki priest, majboor Rahim chacha and many more.The true minority of that state.That's a Gir Bull.There's nothing to be salty about. It's about being sanctimonious without backing it up by the original commenter. I asked for a source, pretty simple. If the guy has source then that should be provided. If not then shut up. This isn't some myriad obfuscate idea that's 'out there'. This is plain presenting the evidence.Yt's algorithm provides better recommendations too.It wasn't so hard, was it?Too much yacking, none of the evidence. There's nothing wrong in opining. If you've got the source, present it. If not then don't spread misinformation under the garb of 'opinion'. It's not your opinion that's the issue here, it's the nonchalant follow through.There's no argument if you can quote the shlok specifically. It's that simple to substantiate your claim.Up you go.Depends on the context, that requires viewing the video in it's entirety.It was on purpose, wardrobes are very cleverly and purposefully selected in any kind of media environment.The judge thinks that the petitioner's arguments don't hold grounds for this to proceed as a case. There's no definite set of rules here. Meaning, a petition may have all the substance and still be rejected by exceptionally exceptional, universally adorned, supremely intelligent judicial overlords. Case in point would be rejection of petition for proper accountability of whatever happened to KPs in the 90s, but acceptance of petition for 1984 anti Sikh riots asking for the same, that is accountability.You seem to be hell bent on exonerating SC's shenanigans in this particular case. CJI is already on record that SC can make or break laws. They already do the latter by abrogating them. Rejected petition concerning a basic fundamental right guaranteed by the 'constitution' shows malicious, or at the very least callous intent. They purport themselves to be an 'independant' non partisan entity only concerned with upholding constitutional 'values'. HR&CE directly violates those. Our legislature, bureaucracy AND jurisprudence have a long legacy or pretence, hypocrisy and scapegoating whenever it's in their stride to do so.

Edit: example of selectivism by SC would be their refusal to entertain a petition for setting up a national men's commision. The reasons they gave were extremely obtuse, borderline indicating that they were being intensionally dense.The stadium is still standing, what activities are you talking about?There were many including Ambedkar. However the most important postive nod came from Gandhi himself. Their reasons may be different though, that's a whole another discussion in itself. Nevertheless many leaders saw it as a net positive and maybe it was. You're also downplaying the role of Muslim League here. They had overwhelming support from their subjects on the issue of partition. It's wasn't some rich zamindars and local feudal leaders.Beti bachao beti padhao is not about promoting stuffy pretentious snoots. This country has bore the brunt of articulated, 'highly educated' people far too many times to ignore that they are out of touch with reality. Miss Moitra is in that very same line. A strong work experience in other fields is a good started doesn't mean the person is actually good at crafting or even asking questions, while Miss Moitra flaunts her opulence, people die I'm her state, especially around elections. She's nowhere to be seen then. Her accolades, 'work background', 'education' doesn't amount to anything if she's unable to do even basic tasks as an MP. Many times these 'highly educated' politicians are just elitists who actually do nothing. That's pathetic on a whole different level.Hmm andhvishwas. Double hmm technology.Very good post OP.Didn't they when Jinnah was alive?So no justice for all those cannibalised kids, pathetic.So you've got nothing coherent or cogent to add to the topic at hand. On top of it you're pussyfooting from the actual topic and also presenting a point of view that has no co-relation here. Brilliant.You already know that's not going to happen.Give me a proper rasam recipe and allam chutney recipe. I will believe your cooking skills üòÑ. Marble chakli is mostly helpful for stretchy doughs that require a lot of oil. Smoother surface, easier management. Puris, naan, Kerala parotta, flatbreads like those are easier to manage on marble.This is just taking a lead from current western cultural hot picks viz. annoying vegans, non-gmo activists etc. Author is just trying to earn his paycheck this month by trying to create a rift where there isn't any.While she fills ash trays, shows opulence and indulgence,  Bengali women face peril to their lives in many districts. Especially when elections are around. Alas, if she'd actually done something to alleviate their situation she'd have had a point. Nevertheless, this is just bhadraloke shenanigans at display.Very bad idea. Hosting Olympics has proven to be a disaster for many countries. Both economically and ecologically.The discomfort and shock is visible in this particular video.Regarding the second part, it's a case of wanting to respond but unable to do so due to sudden nature of assault.Brain pathways work different from physical reactions. During sexual assault, the male or female body may show a state of arousal but essentially is just a result of physical interaction. Brain dissociates itself from the trauma, physically. So when a person is getting assaulted physically, arousal is a physical response, they're not 'enjoying' it. Moreover, many times during such actions human body doesn't know how to react as they have never had understanding of such issues. Sexual organs being caressed in such a way, completely out of the ordinary, without consent will render most people unable to react.She's being a human first. Sexual assault is not a joke.While assault is happening human body responds in incomprehensible ways.

A man can never be assaulted, molested or raped in India. No equity in law. The comments here are really disgusting.Doesn't always happen. It's so out of the ordinary that sometimes people freeze.It's will quickly devolve into womb for hire scam for poor and destitute people. The whole market is already a complete mess with foreigners coming in for baby tourism to remote areas and hiring wombs.Spot on.Maybe you need to take a long hard look at yourself and the whole rhetoric you presented if you think middle East is a bastion of only one religion. Historically it has never been that. It seems you are the one measuring things.Forcing correlation where there's none, TOIlet paper.Spot on.No no, those let off by a political party will not become their enforcers somewhere down the line. People serving life imprisonment aren't hardened criminals for the most part, they are docile creatures.Can of whoop ass, delivered hot and fresh by objective reality.Mr. Sardesai, there already are videos circulating in the media with regards to 'stand' taken by this country's second majority. And they don't agree with your point of view.Take a look at, year of the kraken and rohith verse Twitter handles, no spaces.There are also many HINO based organisationa that have supported Palestine in this conflict. Many of them have associations with organisations known to vomit anti-India and by extension, anti majority bile.That's never going to happen, we have the likes of sir Mahindra who would give podium to people like Yasin Malik stating 'the art of democracy is one of conversation'. They will keep conversing as people with agendas and support from 'intellectual' community fling falsifications.Al jaljeera is sheltered, operated and funded by the country that houses upper echelon leaders of Hamas. It's really interesting to note how they report India knowing this fact. Especially their rhetoric about India's democracy when their government is a constitutional monarchy, with Sharia law being used as a guiding principle.Oh absolutely, but this is nothing new is it? This has been happening for quite long now. STSJ isn't a new naara, stopping processions through their 'areas' isn't new. Political simping for 'minority' too seems to be imbued in our political recourse.There are many educated terrorists in existence. Brainwash can be initiated at any level of education.Hamas is elected by Palestinians, there's no point differentiating between the entities at this point. It's true that information warfare in this conflict has been on point from Israel, but the acts themselves are still being committed by Hamas members, the dead girl with broken limbs being paraded and spit on, the teenager with bloody bottom being forced into the car, bodies pf executed babies, necrophilia, all of this was initiated by Hamas. One can give historical context to it all, but these actions were still committed by Hamas. That changes anybody's perspective, and historical context takes a back seat as it should.Top early to quote this. The current status quo is that legal proceedings against her have been okayed, that's it.Saif Babu ne already bola hi hai ye.And why was this 'introduction' needed? It's almost as if before that Hindus were being goaded into a version with legacy of sarvgaram vadapav. The whole political retort during that time was mired with massacres like moplah, salem, Bharuch, Katarpur, Peshawar (1910) Bengal (1921), CP & Berar (1925-26), Nagpur (1927), Noakhali, Direct Action Day, illegitimate demands by Muslim league, hiding of brutal invasion history, the list is endless. The polity of that time was rooting for an uneasy truce, which wanted a subdued and completely docile 'majority' as shown by Gandhi's statements during that time. Why is there a rise of belief in such ideologue post independence? HR&CE, WAQF, no common law, open ended definition of 'minority' in the constitution, exodus by people across the country. The list is endless. Tumne to sab ignore karke hegemony naamak heavy word maar Diya, uske peeche ka value bhi dekh lo.Do you actually have a legitimate take on the question posted or just wanted to brag about your 'I am leaving' rhetoric? How old are you? 17-25 age bracket? You've reduced a genuine question with legitimate concerns for the people living here to a comic relief.I just buy a large cold drink bottle or a large chocolate bar of some kind, or a bottle of honey. And as I am completing the purchase I ask the shopkeeper politely stating that I am looking forward to staying in following building etc, how's the area in general. Always start with water and electricity, these are the most legitimate concerns and your enquiry will be met with a polite response. The purchasing part is a 'price' for the exchange. Timing also matter, generally shops have very light footfall during 1-4 in the afternoon. People are relaxed mostly and their guards are down. What you are asking are legitimate questions clear your intentions beforehand about the questions, there's no room for suspicion left then. This is almost universal.Spot on. He's very carefully using US laws to steer his bile.Most of it is observation. Let's suppose you go to a new city and try to find a flat. The best way to go about this is to scour areas that meet your requirements, while you stay in a hostel or a PG. This takes a good 2-3 months. During that time you'll come to know about liveable areas and manage your expectations accordingly. I have rented places in many cities across the country and world, it's not that difficult if you're honest about who you are, what you do, what your interests are and other stuff like that. It's better to clear things like noise, friends, alcohol, smoking and stuff like that beforehand. If you get rejected, you get rejected, find another dwelling. Don't hide anything. Also, when looking for a rented accommodation, it's always better to go to a local kirana shop, buy something and casually ask the guy about the building, electricity issues, water, the area in general, average rent rates, stuff like that. Look around for walkable distance based fruit, vegetable vendors, hairdresser, grocer, pharmacy, hospital and public transport. I felt lost many times, but it's okay, that's how these things are supposed to go. Also, first 2-3 times you will make many mistakes and you will learn from them. I was once asked to leave a rented accommodation in Chennai within 1 day before the next midnight, my lease was up in another 9 days. But the flat owner found some tenant. I was in my early 20s back then and not adept to such situations. I resigned from my job, scarily packed my bags all day, and called a friend to help me get to Chennai Central. Just as I was about to leave goons showed up and I just ran from there. The flat owner returned my 10k deposit 2 days after this through a check. A funny one happened when I was living in Dresden, it was quiet hour time and my toilet flush stopped working properly, cherry on the cake; I had stomach flu that night. Somebody called the cops for a noise complaint.How will centre guys take the state back by 50 years? Do you have datapoint based evidence to support your claim? What's 'organic' growth? Young graduates leaving their homestead to find their livelihood everywhere else? Negligible development outside of capital city? No development of public infrastructure? Dilapidated hospitals? How's any of this organic?Who is puneet superstar?It's ironic that you're hopeful and thwarted the same hope in a single sentence. Good observation.The party just has to show to the SC that these are being done on humanitarian grounds. SC will remove the cap in a jiffy.It won't be effective. Brahmins have been sidelined politically, and ridiculed casually in Maharashtra. Everybody is aware of what happened on the night or January 30, 1948 and in days following it. But none of the perps were ever apprehended. There's literature literally calling Brahmins by such vile names that it won't be allowed for any other section of the society.Actually they won't. Private companies will show this as a massive PR campaign and as s gesture of goodwill towards community. There's a reason diversity hires exist, these will come under that grouping.So according to this India has consistently been ranked top 15 since 2017, based on 'data' it has slipped from 'coveted' position of 2nd to 8th in last November assessment. They heard all hullabaloo over 'genocide' calls from only one side, that too most of them debunked claims or diffused claims made by loners. But somehow completly missed calls made by PFI, Raza Academy and others. The agency could not find anything wrong with Mewat, they did not hear STSJ calls, attacks on processions, desecration of temples. Selective hearing problem? If being biased and hypocrisy would've been awared these orgs would be the best ones there. Oh wait such awards already exists that supports the whole ecosystem of whitewashing things as per their current relevant narrative. The org predicts India being 8th on said tinderbox of genocide in 2023. It's already 2nd week for October, 2023. The list marks Iran at 30 (the same state that is allegedly supplying logistics to Hamas in current Israel situation), heck it ranks literal war torn, ethnocide rife African nations far lower than India. Brilliant assessments.Why do 'dalits' in US need special protection? Previous laws are doing their job. You keep on asking where did you generalize, I've answered that question 3 replies ago I guess. If special protection is the way to go then why not for UCs? Non UCs are being marginalized in the US? Not being given opportunities? Based on what datapoints exactly? On feelings and accusations is it? They need reservations there too? How old is the claim of historical atrocities unleashed on them in the US? 7000-8000 years? Did the famous Columbia alum demand reservations and special treatments in the US? It's a land that provides equitable opportunities, not equal, equitable. You want to say that casteist slurs aren't hurled by non-UCs on UCs? Is that why so many politicians openly ridicule UCs and get away with it? Because it's okay to do so? I have already stated that a superfluous law makes no sense. It will be creating an active anti UC narrative in a land that doesn't concern itself with its legacy, basically a target on their backs. If that's what you want then say that openly. Why all this subterfuge? Such one sided laws exist in India, these vehemently disregard that the other side can/does indulge in the same behaviour that they are supposed to be protected from. Make the law term neutral, that provision already exists in US law, that is as clear as day.You have comprehension issues is it? Did I say it doesn't happen? My gripe here is very simple; you are generalizing based on nothing; especially when it comes to discrimination in the US, discrimination is already covered under their law structure, plain and simple. If you want to deduce anything else then it's your prerogative.There's no need for it. Plain and simple. Discrimination is already well covered. Indian law makes special provisions for everyone, with zero repercussions to falsifications under oath. Laws like SC/ST act, DV laws under HMA are absolutely abused by the people and they go scot free all the while ruining peoples' lives. There's no need for another law in specificiy when there are already existing provisions for a problem.You started your salvo by using 'people who are commenting here', prove the prevalence. If it's anectodal then it's of no use, if it's survey based even then it's of no use. People can claim whatever to push their rhetoric. Cali gov knocked down a supposedly superfluous law. US law does not work like Indian law; where people keep on adding unnecessary sections and to hope that the case runs in perpetuity. Their jurisprudence actually takes their job seriously. Any kind of discrimination against anybody is already covered under law. They do not provide special privileges to everyone based on who shouts the loudest, at least for now.Just because it happens doesn't give you the right to generalize people.I am not an UC and haven't faced discrimination anywhere. Name calling is equally taken and given to all castes. I am not sitting in any tower. I am also one of the people commenting here. Why the sweeping generalizations all the time? Talk about yourself and be done with your rhetoric. 

Edit: I have worked around the world, faced racism, but no casteism. Again, not an ivory tower.Common acted really well in Hunter Killer.This, precisely. A lot of people don't even know about this.I know that. OP has posed a really obfuscate question while also stating his secular traits in a preemptive way.

One of them is Taliban. Their relationship with Pakistan is currently a tinderbox that can be lit up by using any of the factions.Yup, surveys census, whatever they are. It's just based on responses given by people. No identity is actually established, moreover SC has already given quota rights to converted masses. Victim card in perpetual motion. 

I totally forgot replying to you about disabling starlink. Many hardware and software based chinks in the system have already been identified. Ground stations can be easily sabotaged, the best way is to simply cut power and also to cut optical fibre connections. If remote power is being provided then too ground stations require upkeep. Whenever communication is established with sat, any SHORAD can be used to Target said ground stations. Most of the satellite link in starlink currently is mostly KA band, portable/stationary jammers can be deployed. The point is, there is no single solution, but there are multiple simple ones if push comes to shove.Thank you very much. I also found some literary source.

Many design options for your foot ergonomics in general. Next best bet would be Puma.Get TDS checked at any local water purifier selling store. That's the first step, depending on that further solutions change. If TDS is within levels then Carbon+UF+UV is sufficient. RO is only recommended for TDS above ~500ppm. Also check for water hardness levels. BARC provides for many  cheap and effective purifier solutions through technology transfer to private entities. TDS controllers in most purifiers is a sham. You will have to make a cursory visit to your nearest water purifier store. Then ask the question here for better guidance.Financial data and personal profile data are two different data sets. People readily give their personal data because it's relatively harmless from their perspective.

If a public performance is done and so called tolerance is to be practiced by the public, then the content creator will have to tolerate criticism from various sections of the society. Tolerance goes both ways, bending over backwards doesn't.I already have enough exposure. It's a lame argument because it's used by people to perpetually victimize themselves. So power currupts, okay then what do you propose, doing nothing? I question every government, state, district, taluk whatever level it is. And not just out of turn questioning, properly backed questions. I graduated college more than a decade ago. I have had a brush with governments from taluka to state levels, on very valid issues. It may seem disappointing at first. But the moment one feels like there's nothing to fight for, the plot is lost. Plain and simple. There's no cross correlation between the amount of money one has and replies on reddit.Power corrupts is a very lame argument to shun any kind of responsibility.

Post Kargil war incidents, the number is probably in tens of thousands, about 4000 was the number in 2012, it's been more than a decade since then. You want to keep sports and arts out of ambit of national interests on 'humanitarian' grounds? Okay, let them consider us humans first. Many of their actors too have spewed vitriol from time to time.

Raid-lockup-bail-gyaan-no punishment, unnecessary wastage of tax payers' money.It hasn't shifted the burden of proof. CAA just introduces special provisions for certain religions to get expedited citizenship. That is a valid arrangement given the rapid deterioration of minority survival circumstances in our eponymous neighborhood. This land is rightfully their home. Moreover, franchise of already existing citizens of second majority of this country isn't being stripped away, in any form whatsoever. It's complete balderdash to state otherwise. Infact they enjoy many special provisions like WAQF and polygamy. Nevertheless, people from religions other than those mentioned in the bill haven't been turned away from citizenship either. They will have to take the regular path, plain and simple. NRC is a registry of citizens, which happens to be a necessity everywhere in the world. There's no point confusing CAA and NRC.Economically disadvantaged, yes. But this shouldn't be exclusive to them. These institutes inspite of their many flaws act as gateways to the world. They provide for everything an engineer can ever ask for, especially in realtion with Indian infrastructure. A massive amount of government resources are put behind each and every single graduate. Every student there has a privilege, a massive duty and a sense of establishment that will remain with them for their lives. They owe it to themselves too. It's easy to fall for false prophets, shallow thought processes and ideological subversion in premier institutes though.That'd be a humanitarian issue, SC will swoop in impromptu with a suo moto.I don't understand the comment.Synopsys isn't a chip design giant.

It breaks down molecules on skin to produce Vitamin D3. And that's just a start. There's a whole plethora of things that go down. Eat a citrus and fatty fruit, get some sun time and physical exercise. Human body always, always prioritises physical being over mental being. When you sweat, basic physiology takes over.

Economic equity brings everyone to the table, plain and simple.It's made up all sorts of people. Undergrads have some courses of art, theatre, drama and such. Then during mood Indigo students interact with people of 'revolutionary thinking' from other institutions. Basically students from extremely poor or poor background do not care for such things. They attend their classes and have their targets set. People participating in such are mostly ones who got into the institute with relative ease.That perception of Marathi being a gaavthi language is mostly among city dwelling CBSE educated folks. That's something quite common in almost all cbse schools across the country. You are oversimplying what shiv Sena and MNS did. The issues then were completely different. I have lived in at least 5 different cities in Maharashtra.  The socio-political pressure point created then was a necessity as giving it a religious flare would not have worked. City centric is all fine, only city centric is not. BBSR has its priority extremely skewed towards outward showboating, in terms of public infra, socio-cultural, socio-political and socio-economic issues. It doesn't give me pleasure to bash my homestead. But it is what it is. Development has to have rigor to it, which is sadly lacking. I am positive of changes to come, but whatever has happened till date isn't on the right track and my biggest fear is Odias not realising this at all, especially the youth.Knowing UK coppers, he will have to sadly make arrangements for his own safety.Not even in the slightest.See, immigration is natural. Being assertive and being aggresive may sound similar, but are not. It's also better to not learn anything in that regard from Bengal or Tamil Nadu. Maharashtra and Gujarat are better examples, apart from some political riff raffs, these states have their cultural status quo quite well represented without being aggressive at all times. Their carrying of their cultures is something that makes people respect them. We can do that easily too, but our culture has no icons in the modern world to emulate and propagate. Nevertheless, the first thing that we can do is not simp for any state. Mutual respect is the key. Development metrics are honestly skewed though, outside of capital city and its twin there's still a massive lack of basic infra and subsequent facilities. We have a long way to go. I am honestly disappointed by the way a Cuttack or Bhubaneshwar native treats people from Ganjam or Keonjhar as an example.I currently work in VLSI industry. Have more than a decade of experience, the investment is good but our state isn't ready for it. Especially the technical expertise part that's necessary. There's also a lack of critical thinking from padha likha strata. I was very excited about the whole prospect, and am still very bullish and positive about it in general. Our state needs to put in efforts towards traning graduates in the field, the native talent pool currently is zero. As it is we Odias have a problem of not being assertive enough, with such a high tech industry in the offing, we will lose sight of our nativity very fast. With a high tech industry, there will be demographic, socio-political, socio-cultural and socio-economic changes. Our population needs to have the necessary strength to embrace it; all the while standing tall on our native cultural status.Electrical, m.tech.Graduated more than a decade ago. The mix up with friends is a personal equation that can easily be worked out between them. Situations as presented in the post happen only when people poke their noses in places where it isn't needed and self-victimize in the process.Turd tier bait.Absolutely, unequivocally, intrepidly spot on.I studied there and am well aware of the shenanigans that the said group is always upto. For my own sanity and safety I won't be going into the details. Sukua is an example to illustrate a broader point; the point being smells and sight of non-vegetarian food is disturbing to many. I am not even a vaishnav, I am a shakta. We are supposed to be voracious mest eaters, at least that's the silly narrative. The base equation here is, a simple preference based allocation was met, that's it. Same with reservation based admissions to the said institute, many get in with far lower cut-offs than others. It's a provision made to correct supposed wrongs in the society. Many have to undergo remedial teaching because they can't even do basic calculus. In this situation students asked for a provision to be made in specificiy to their food preferences. Same goes for halal products, same goes for kosher products too. Jai Jagannath.We can change, we will have to change. The first thing is to be more assertive, but that assertion has to come from a point of complete authority. In our day to day lives the best thing we can do is shun mediocrity in general. It's a fair assumption that we can't play in modern world with ancient principles. Machines may change from time to time, principles of mechanism and subsequent mechanisation still remains the same. Ancient principles are a good guiding light. Problem is we don't like light itself for now. Nevertheless there's always hope.A destabilized India plays into interests of both the West and China. Long decision times, even longer implementation time and complete chaos works very well for their bottom line. Instability brings hunger for the people to survive and give their utmost to any situation, ergo capitalism thrives with whatever work conditions and salary. Even if/when we emigrate we become model citizens wherever we go, and will have the same zeal to work without questioning the status quo. Heck very few of us even take a stand against casual obnoxious behaviour by foreigners. It all plays very well for them.While we may have the acumen to do that, our people don't have that mindset.An overwhelming number of suicide attempts are just that, attempts. Attempts for attention. The attention seeking behaviour maybe because of a myriad of reasons, but not lot of people actually want to be dead, they just want someone to notice.Justify what? What does this have to do with mostly non-vegetarian state? I eat non-vegetarian food and have respect for those who don't. I'm not obnoxious about it. Most people who don't eat non-vegetarian food cannot stand it's sight and smell, it's not something they can control. Many times gag reflex also comes to fore, that happens across the world. However, in my time of living with many different people across countries I have seen people have this common courtesy to leave people be when it comes to food habits. Many people do that in India too, but too many people take it as a sense of some kind of achievement to mock vegetarians. Which honestly makes no sense. In this case Vegetarians needed a small corner to eat without the sight and smell of non-vegetarian food and their appeal was heard. It's a preference based provision, not segregation. Many people in my family revere chaitanya mahaprabhu, I lived with some of them for some time, I actually saw them get nauseated by smells, especially of sukua. They tried hiding their problem, but eventually they had to request me to use different utensils and to do something about the smell. I understood their predicament and obliged. It's really simple to understand. I really don't get what any of this has to do with my native state and the food patterns contained within.Which bill is stripping Muslim franchise?

If one doesn't agree with their drivel, the alternate ideologue is fascist. Which is ironic considering how they keep harping on freedom of whatever is in vogue that week, but never anything that they don't like.Yeah, you're right. I have entangled with the study circle as a student in IITB. IITM one and this group are sister concerns with zero actual concerns in real life.Students in US universities have the common courtesy to not pester people for their personal preferences. Due to that administration doesn't have to step in. Even in such situations, problems do arise.Imagine if seats are reserved for admission to the said institutions. Reserved seats that have different, many times lower cut-off levels for entry. Where's the furore? Oh wait, that's already happened. Making provisions for people isn't inherently evil. Same logic for halal, also just FYI, halal is majorly about preparation and procurement of the said foods. Halal reservation in seating arrangement won't make much sense. If you want topic for pussyfooting then try to frame it as halal food eating choice being imposed on everybody without a choice.No irony, it's deliberate subterfuge and subsequent sabotage. Has been happening for a long time.As a former student, this is sadly true.Car and television is unnecessary for me.Mate, lead poisioning creates havoc for many body systems, endocrine being one of them. Diseases caused by such accumulation can sometimes also be passed down to upcoming generation.I support use of nitrile gloves where it's necessary and gloves in general for hygiene issues. I also understand that such implementation has a cost overhead that will have to be borne by the end consumer. But health is very important and anything going haywire it creates major issues down the line. See, this is a very complex issue and requires very comprehensive solutions. A middle way has to be found.I am already agreeing with you mate. My comments are an addendum to your points, not a tirade against them.That's the whole reason I said multi pronged approach is necessary. Petroleum products won't be replaced so easily. Hence management is necessary. There actually are many good solutions available. The problem is different types of plastics being so mainstream and no sustainable plus scalable way to recycle/upcycle/destroy it in abway that's beneficial to people and profitable at doing all of that.This is a sort of smart product delivery. By using plastic bottles companies just passed the buck of managing waste towards consumers and subsequently the authorities. They washed their hands off it. The switch from glass bottles to plastic ones has tremendously increased waste load while also increasing company bottomlines. They did it stating quality control and consumer ease reasons which is true but the end result is increased load already burdened public waste management capabilities. A multitude of solution la through multi pronged approach is required.I wasn't aware of this initiative. Thank you. You're also spot on with hygiene standards being demanded and subsequently set by the consumers.That too will happen in a short few years. The push will not be by the government, but by the judiciary.Hasn't it already?A plumber created the recent cascade of events.Depends on who eats what.The Persian loan word maybe a staple only in relatively urbanised or mixed places. Dehaat in general still uses nun.That's gur in Hindi, gul in Marathi, the word means jaggery. Love the username, filing to the stomach, nourishing to the body.‡§ó‡•ã‡§°I thought faltu was copy of accepted. Nevertheless googled it and not interested in anything that has Ali Zafar as the lead.Vaccines protect against severity of the disease when it hits. When a viral load hits the body, body's immune response fights back. This happens because antibodies for the evolving viral load have already been trained into the immune system. Vaccine wasn't effective is a very generic and to some extent a false statement.What is fukrey 3?Freebie culture will always exist and has always existed, especially in independent India. Our constitution wills our society to be a welfare state. It's unfortunate that the freebie culture is able to sway votes, but that's how vox populi works.

Edit: when I say constitution wills it I am not talking about addition of word in the preamble. I am talking about Article 38. [further read ](https://www.legalservicesindia.com/article/507/Concept-of-Welfare-State-and-Its-Relevance-in-Indian-Scenario.html)We have many other things to be provided for free. Personal tax regime still isn't properly implemented on majority of the population. Higher education will eventually become free. But that eventually will have to take it's own time. In the meanwhile it's heavily subsidised for many sections of the current Indian society.OP has made a half hearted post. He's probably talking about EU countries like Germany and Finland.Racism against Indians is very well noted, propagated, tolerated and instigated by everyone around the world. Sadly, in many cases Indians themselves stand wholeheartedly with those who do that. Calling it out in any way possible doesn't make you a snowflake OP. A lot of Indians find themselves validated when foreigners use those slurs on them. You don't and that's good.Jai Jagannath üôèI wish I could've upvoted this more than once. Spot on mate.TOIlet paper for a reason.I have complained to concerned bodies while living in Dresden, Espoo, Cupertino and some other cities. Prompt action has been taken everywhere. I have also initiated such actions in India, government bodies take some time to respond, but their work has almost always been hindered by people like you. A civil suit was once filed by one of the dog lovers, the case ran for about 1.5 years, finally the dog was put down AFTER it had bitten 3-4 little kids in the society. No presence of a video isn't proving your rhetoric. Absense of evidence isn't absense of the act itself you embossed carbuncle. Usually I don't go around looking into user profiles but I did in your case given your comments here. Needless to say your comments on a previous dog related incident are incoherent to say the least. I am no longer inclined in any further comments. Just visit someone who dies of rabies once, I am pretty sure you won't understand what the person feels, because you're a dark empath with inclination towards dogs. But at least try to understand how horrible the disease is. Also, rabies shots only provide a temporary immunity, thus rendering the problem circular and repetitive in nature.Next time that happens I will make a video and post it to you. Just FYI, not all rabies afflicted dogs show outward symptoms and it's 100% fatal to humans once it gets hold. While you and your ilk may preach solutions like spaying and neutering, it's a time consuming and money guzzling endeavour. Moreover, whenever a plan of action is set into place, even when it's only animal control vans catching and releasing strat dogs, municipal officials face resistance from 'concerned' ctitizens. The matter of the fact is India is rabies central, SC is passing legislations protecting street dogs and passing the buck to the local government. Heck people don't even know how to control their pet dogs.It's not the government, it's the overzealous citizens. PILs are put to fore whenever a mass action plan is created to tackle the menace. SC comes to their protection.This simple point is not something that most dog lovers comprehend.And they will meet vehement resistance from irrational dog lovers.This is an interesting read. Much appreciated OP.Forgot palghar?I see nothing wrong in this. These guys are true upholders of secularism. Bashing the majority community is what secularism means and by extension bashing anybody from the said community by using choicest of expletives. Even when done by members of the so called majority community itself. That's what post independence India has been a shining beacon of light for. This is what freedom of speech is, bashing people based on their perceived societal role. But vice versa can never be true. No one cannot badmouth the other way. In this particular case, SC/ST act can come to fore, freedom of speech is always selective. 

/S obviously.Define UCC, have you read the tenets outlined in it? Have you read them and understood their implications completely? Will the law, whenever it comes to fore be actually applied to ground situation without discrimination? Do the keepers of law have the guts to prosecute someone with more than one wife? Do the policymakers have it in them to actually make laws gender neutral? If anybody from the system shows gumption to actually uphold the law in its entirety then I am with them. Where does UCC talk about HR&CE? Where does it talk about waqf?

Edit: my previous comment was sarcastic, I thought it was obvious.Sure. They were tremendous keepers of peace and had vehement religious tolerance too.Visit a doc and discuss this with them. If it's significant enought for you to make a post, then it's good enough for a doc visit. All the best.It's not about humanity, it's about getting entangled in court conundrum. Many times first responders will be harassed by the system. No good act goes unpunished.Oh completely, so is HR&CE, so are religion specific marriage laws. Absolutely secular. You are the bigot to ask such a question.Okay so marauders, dictators,  zealots, mass murderers, plunderers are still valid right? Or are those word associations to be disregarded as well?Looks fulfilling. What were the spots you visited?1. Don't use aeroflot.
2. Don't roam around on your lonesome after dark. Especially if you're going to live in the outskirts. 
3. Basic Russian will help you really well. Basic like asking for water, food, directions. Learn how their currency denomination works. People in general are helpful. 
4. Pack in thermal wear. Three layers will be needed. Inner thermal, outer thermal, and overcoat sometimes. Pack mittens, extra pairs of socks and extra pair of underwear, you will need them. Weather will be really good till the end of October, winter starts after that. Also get good head protection against winter. Deer stalkers work best. 
5. There are many places called dubna in Russia. I guess you're going to the Moscow one. It's relatively quite a safe place. 
6. Make a kit box with anti emetic medicines, anti bacterial, some kind of electrolyte in powder form. Some cold medicine (you will need it). Some kind of antiseptic, package all of these in your main luggage and buy them new, sealed packs. 
7. Memorise the number of your nearest embassy and consulate. 
8. Keep your passport protected. Also, memorize where you're going to live and nearby areas, marked with places to find food and shelter. 
9. Use Aeroexpress to roam around. The city (Moscow) is very beautiful. Don't travel alone. Subway network is quite good too. 
10. Carry a valid photo id at all times. 
11. Be ready to eat boiled beetroot and cabbage soups. These will actually help a lot in bulking up stools and passing motions as gut biome changes with changing weather and food patterns. Do take into consideration your personal food preferences of vegetarian and non-vegetarian, specific kinds of non-vegetarian foods etc. 
12. Guard you luggage when traveling and once you reach your accomodation, stow it away safely.

Wishing you safe travels and a happy, successful trip.

Edit: one major thing, while roaming around if a deal seems too good to be true, it most definitely is. Remove yourself from that situation swiftly. Same works for people.Mate, there's one thing that desi males need to understand very clearly. We are despised by everybody just for existing. The gross generalization and misrepresentation mixed with casual and surgical misandry propagated by general media has willed this into existence. Even amongst brown males, desi male is on the lowest rung. People will bring in statistics, will bring in unsubstantiated claims like 'not all crimes against women are reported'. But won't take even a second before generalizing ~560 million males. Just for example, he mentioned acid attacks, well those attacks happen on males too, in quite large nunbers. but there's no official statistics to record it specifically, so nobody is sure of the numbers. News channels don't report it and it just remains as a placeholder in local newspapers at best. The crappy attitude that he's presented is quite normalised by desis, whites, Asians; it's basically race agnostic. Heck our own SC thinks we shouldn't exist, with misandry based laws, no provision for men's commision and many more issues. For example when a 498a is lodged, even kids are taken in for questioning, sometimes put into lockups. Nevertheless, it's quite easy for them to rant such filth, because we normalised and to some extent validated such treatment of desi men.Who let a 17 real edgy boy with comprehension of a 13 year old and pick me up attitude use Internet?I'd love nothing better than to be in my home state; live, pray, prosper and eventually perish. However, the state provides nothing in terms of my career growth or even bare minimum of prospects in my chosen field. I have been trying to find some way to create a niche for the said field in Odisha. If that doesn't happen then I will have to move back only after I retire. I don't want to retire before a certain value addition in the said field and want to move back before I retire.Spot on.He doesn't want to take one it seems, flight of stairs I mean.Your rhetoric has some merit, but you need to frame it better mate.India at that time was supposed to be a Soviet backyard. Hence US tried to align with Pakistan.Non-alignment is like playing with no one. Doesn't work and failed India when NAM was at its peak. Better way is to play along with our interests as the highest priority. We need to develop capabilities that make us indispensable.Spot on.*Trudeau senior. Justin is just continuing what his father established.The book isn't alarmist, it's realist. It's a good read.They don't have anything better to do.You've established association of Indian intelligence with abject precision it seems. You should publish it, let everyone know how it happened, an innocent man was done for by an authoritarian state. You can't simply sit on such evidence.So this does not concern 'common' Indian? The allegations have come after months if not years of almost zero reciprocation from Canadian side and also provocations. Reciprocations on proofs provided to them,  provocations from their citizens of a certain religion against other religion, that's called hate speech. Khalistanis have been using thei nations as a pedestal to push vitriol and misinformation for more than two decades now. Nations like Canada are supposed to he beacons of shining light in justice and plurasim. Their exceptionally vociferous institutions are supposed to safeguard their citizens and immigrants. They did not do that and kept mum all this while. Suddenly someone offs a random citizen somewhere and the blame falls on India. Ironically let's suppose that Indian agencies were involved in this, they somehow chose to Target such a nobody, that's just brilliant. The so called wingers maybe over enthusiastic, but what you're insinuating by separating yourself completely from the situation, by using the word 'common' isn't of any use either. In case of such extreme malice and prejudice your first response as a citizen is to segregate yourself completely.The problem is them not even trying at all. Match or no match, comes later.Dead spot on.The first answer is so exceptionally generic. A highschool senior will have better thoughts, diction and views. This is a sitting MP in an OECD nation that the current ruling government supports? Even if there aren't original ideas apart from the regular drivel, at least better articulation is expected. It's also funny how a sympathizer of murderers advocates for action against any entity, whatsoever.Hardware provides and software utilizes is correct. But hardware need not use software at all given times. It's only true for digital hardware in general. Nevertheless my example meant however good a software is, it has to have processes that utilizes the capabilities of a particular hardware. If/when the hardware changes, software has to change. ARM is an ISA, apple's SoCs are homemade by them, those SoCs utilise ARM as an instruction set. A16 the last gen SoC from apple in  September 2022 contained LPDDR5 for the first time, used AArch64 (ARMv8.6) instruction set under ARM ISA family. A15 from 2021 used LPDDR4, used (ARMv8.5). Snapdragon 778G had LPDDR5 in Q2 2021, quite sometime before A15, Snapdragon 865 har LPDDR5 at 2750 MHz, Quad Channel mode; this processor existed in since early 2020. The previous apple a15 and snapdragon 778G were at 3200MHz dual channel. Snapdragon 888, LPDDR5, quad channel 3200MHz exists since early 2021. Snapdragon's next gen processor has quad channel LPDDR5 at 4200 MHz. These comparisons are only on the basis of memory. There are other factors like process node, embedded storage technology, cache sizes and levels, GPU features, DSP features to be considered too. Both may have similar ISAs does not mean their actual features are similar. Mobile processors in general have 7 key variants, viz. MediaTek, Exynos, K-series, Google tensor, UniSoc, Apple and Snapdragon. All of them use ARM ISA, but have varied performance. A single point comparison is absolutely moot. Every company in this space especially the giant ones have to spend billions in R&D, doesn't mean their products always reflect that effort.Software, however optimised it maybe won't be able to work if hardware cannot take it or has no provisions to understand it. A software process optimised to work on DDR2 won't be able to utilise what DDR5 has to offernand vice versa, especially if backwards compatibility is not provided. There's always a certain tradeoff involved, it's never a simple yes or no evaluation.You're free to use whatever product fits your needs. My basic 20k Android device works absolutely fine for me and has worked so for the past 4 years. Hardware can be experienced through software is not something I stand with. Software optimisation provided by apple in some of their products is definitely good. There's no denial there. Apple gets their taste for anti consumer practices because of their fanboys. Just like the guy presented in the post. Standing in line to lose money on a device that one is inadvertently paying a high price for is exactly what gives apple their inflated ego. Costly phone in Android ecosystem works too.I won't say that they won't be able to run the games. They certainly would, but not to the level as one may think, by looking at their numbers as presented. Tech reviews too I won't put much of my efforts into. Honest review is only possible after the product is out and has been daily driven for maybe about 6 months. By honest I don't mean the reviewer is being dishonest. I am saying in terms of technical fidelity of the said device. There's always a marked difference between out of the box and daily driven electronic devices. Regarding your first line I won't say it'd be drastically different, but it definitely would be different. My contention here is only based on cost to feature issues and cost to performance issues. Also, when you run software metrics it depends on the software's optimisation too. iOS and Android both have different approaches to application and how they perform.Yeah, that 1lac is more about range. I could've used better wording like high end or flagship. Prices are subjective anyways.It's okay, we can talk here. Sorry but I don't use DMs.Yup, that's sadly true.Even in the recently announced usb c physical charging port based models, one model contains usb 2 protocol data transfer speed support and other model contains modern usb c speed support. This is just pathetic at another level.Okay, so I have a master's in VLSI from IITB with more than 10 years of experience in front end chip design and some in verification. I also have worked in multiple state of the art projects related to chip nodes. I was also active in A9 bionic chip design in some capacity (can't state it exactly, NDA). When I say it's garbage, I am not saying it from an aesthetic design, software, 'eco-system' perspective. I am saying it from the cost to features provided perspective. It's not out of spite, I have actually seen how apple regularly fudges hardware performance numbers. Their comparisons are run in engineering environments tailored to make their machine win. Not to say that they don't sometimes make good decisions, like the touch screen revolution. Cost to performance and cost to feature rich phones mostly fall in the 20k category. In the above 1lac segment Samsung and Google flagships are better. The only problem is Android's recent non-chalance regarding software patches. Then again that's a software issue not a hardware issue. Call me ignorant, I am comfortable with my decisions.Pro plus ultra instinct god mode.Yup.Yup, spot on. In specificity to a point made by you, many diseases were brought to the natives by the settlers who reached there.Depends on the person. If the question asked and responses gained provide with the proper perspective then they aren't stupid. But if they insist on a certain outcome, then maybe they need to introspect. Nevertheless, stupid isn't an objectively quantifiable term so I personally don't categorise people that way. However there's a caveat involved, you can't really reason with stubborn people as they will drag you down to their level. So it's better sometimes to leave people in their little bubble of falsifications. It's something like, you know they're stupid, and you then try to reason with them beyond a certain point. What does that make you?This is just balderdash, nothing else. No plan of action, no names talen, no assurances provided. Just a lame condemnation. Do this to a white minority population in any Asian nation, the nation will feel what strong statement means. They have given a safe haven to despots for many decades now. Heck kanishka bombing convicts were given shamefully meagre sentences even after almost 20 years or investigation.I have personally made many Brits aware of ills of their crown around the world, especially India. I have done so with proofs, I have done so with using famine images. They still don't care for the actions, and shrug it by simply saying, it's in the past or by stating that people with higher intelligence/better resources won. I wasn't seeking apology or even some kind of reciprocation, at that point. I just thought of it all as something people should know. It doesn't matter to them is what I have personally observed. Mind you these are the same people who won't forget what the Nazis did for example and won't let anyone else forget too. Not that it should ever be forgotten. But there's more to the world history than world war 2, more people died due to the crown' deliberate actions in their colonies. 

Left does what it does. Their very existence is based on falsifications and being selective to whatever pushes their anti-establishment, anti-culture, anti-family narrative.No questions are stupid.Spot on.Hello OP,

1. Yes, they are very clear about their pontifications over India. They have allegiance to their history and culture and are very well aware of where there priorities lie. 


2. Geopolitics has no permanent friend or foe, they're very well aware of this too. It's our general population that doesn't understand this. That's not their fault, we need introspection. 


3. They aren't jealous, it's just plain superiority complex. People think they are unaware of whatever happened with the subcontinent within the last two centuries and how it's still happening. The point is, they won't care even if they become aware of it. 


4. They have the bigger stick hence they get to bully us. We don't even try to fight most of the time. Gora sahab greatest is still ingrained in our minds. Especially at higher levels of the 'intellectual' society of this country. 


5. Above everything else they protect their interests and popular narrative. Our population in general does the opposite of it, we try to belittle our interests at any provided chance without actually understanding the issue at hand. We never do our own due diligence before uttering crap. 


6. Country's foreign policy is based on many factors like trade volumes, mutually agreeable common interests, bon homie between citizens etc. We need the west because they currently have the biggest stick. They know it, we should understand it very clearly. 


7. Anything and everything that they do is first and foremost for their benefits, it's not out of some kind of love for us or our history or culture or other such emotional stuff. For individuals that maybe the case, not for policy makers. Most businesses and individuals see a business opportunity and take it and we fall for it all the time everytime. We have to make ourselves strong first.


8. China realised that they have no allies and are clearly far ahead of us in many things. Even if the conditions for their citizens aren't ideal. They were very shrewd about driving their country, even when communist regimes were crumbling down all around the world and still are. Our citizens indulge in empty idealism. That makes them tone deaf to reality of the world.If they have acquired proof by the means of tapping then we have to first assess our embassy officials. Irrespective of whatever UN may say or general courtesy may dictate, embassies are spy hubs. The expectation is that every communication will be interrupted and listened to. Especially in a country known to house terrorist and give them podium under the guise of freedom of speech. Nevertheless, if they have any kind of proof of this then releasing it isn't necessary from official channels. There can always be leaks and hacks.Apple will award his dedication with another overpriced garbage next year.Yup. This unnecessary bonhomie then leads to bad blood when the feeling isn't mutual. This whole martial race nonsense has created a superiority complex in the minds of people. And this lopsided thinking with respect to armed forces having highest numbers of a certain ethnicity is mostly due to mass entertainment.Gorkhas[1. ](https://youtu.be/ZjIg60Si3i8?si=glfoLeqvqIN_UtmS)

It will surely be followed with other types of alerts about imminent threats to citizens.That's exceptional Indian jurisprudence followed by vociferous non partisan secularism for you.

obviously /sNo, there's no statistical confirmation of that. Armed forces have contributions from every community in the country and some outside the country too.His state already has 69% reservation. What is he cribbing about?Oh okay. I don't listen to hip-hop and haven't had had any brush with desi pop music in the last decade or so. Nevertheless, if he's at such level then this is plain idiocy from his side.Who is this guy? Is he significant in music? Never heard of him. What's MTV hustle?Chitta rules, gabru drools.OP, your base assumption is correct and per capita consumption point is spot on. Instead of ban use the word restrictions next time. Ban has a very heavily negative connotation in people's minds. The original commenter there is misinformed about the vegetarian trope in the sense that many people divide their non vegetarian food inclusion based on their sampradaay rules. The metric has now been overly simplified into a question of just veg or non veg. Nevertheless, good comment.Agreed with all points except the one about creating a new central service branch. We have way too much bureaucracy as it is. It'd be better to have an exclusive competent authority setup to overlook infra development, with defined goals. This can be implemented at City and State levels.Wishing the same to you mitra.I've lived outside the state since my childhood. Used to visit my homestead once or twice every year, it's still the only place I call home (a small hamlet in Kalahandi, with some family in Ganjam). Roamed the country as a kid and young adult. World thereafter. Missing Odia food is a constant for me, especially badi chura, khiri, dahi bara, mitha bara with chana tarkari, chakuli pitha and a few others. Many people ask questions like is it a separate state, is it a part of WB, how bad are naxalites, are all people Adivasis? I have always found those questions to be a part of natural curiosity rather than racist diatribe (which too has happened, mostly in Chennai and Bengaluru. Hyderabad, places in UP, Maharashtra, Gujarat and Delhi have been very welcoming). Annoyingly though the most cold shoulder behaviour I've received has been from fellow Odias living outside the state and Odias from the twin cities of Bhubaneshwar and Cuttack. I rarely back down from stereotype based attacks on a personal level, but sometimes it becomes a bit overwhelming, for example I once got into an argument with someone from Kerala over pronunciation of dosa. He kept insisting how it's called dosha and how we butcher every pronunciation, I just stated how we have our own versions of it and dosa isn't something endemic to the south. Nevertheless, I have observed one behaviour of educated Odias in general, they don't double down on such acts, they just let it pass and then crib about it later. That makes me sad. I want my state to be recognised for it's proper art, culture and hopefully industrialization when it happens. And I also have or pipe dream of seeing a better class of cinema from Odisha, both mass entertainment and social messaging based.Depends on the available drugs.Ye kya hai har jagah jidhar bhi Mann kare n word use kar lo.

His tour was cancelled as a consequence of him being stupid. The said stupidity was intbhe form of presenting a morphed map on a social media website.

They are resource rich, but tapping those resources requires hard labor.Are we talking about China here? CCP mouth piece news head actually drubbed Canada for their idiosyncratic remarks in this regard. If you want to discuss that pov then you should decidedly make a seperate posts with the said recent videos. Why is there a need to commit whataboutery in this thread that is entirely about something else?Spot on.It's not ineptitude, it's willful ignorance.Okay, good to know.Political mileage from Trudeau's side and lollygagging the Canadian parliament in general for NDP, i.e. Sikh representative party. Trudeau's party has I think 115 seats and NDP has 25. Trudeau's government stands on coalition. To rally support from Sikh diaspora he needs NDP by his side. Current NDP head is giving himself too much importance by thinking that his allegiance to Trudeau will mean something in terms of power. Canada is up for elections in 2 years, let's see what happens then. This fundamentally is the reason why coalitions with forces that you don't understand do not work.Spot on.Nothing in international media is a coincidence or is it ever a mistake. There are desks assigned for Intel gathering in news organisation. They need to do their due diligence in case of libel. They are very well aware of the situation, their local population may not be as well versed, but organizations are. Whatever they're reporting, projecting, paraphrasing is deliberate.People really don't know the history of MIM it seems.Spot on.Not worth the intekam, life is a mirror thst gets shinier as days pass and one get's older.Wait till the women you mentioned in point no. 2 get questioned by the prospective guy and be ready to receive a schooling from her, sometimes her parents and friends too.

CVD, diabetes and other category of diseases will catch up with them as they cross 30-35.They aren't ignorant. They know where their allegiance is, they're steadfast and faithful towards it. For example, people in India think regular Brits have no idea of what they did in the subcontinent. The point however is that they won't/don't care either way.These awards aren't the only way. Languages carry inflections, those carry emotions. The barrier does matter. Indian cinema has enough PR power to pull economic strings and increase their reach of they wanted to.The moment we restrict our art to cinema we've done a grave injustice to history. I understand your point and respect your gumption too. But, the academy doesn't represent world cinema. World cinema in itself is a misnomer, people of the world may have similar emotions but the ways to depict those emotions vary a lot. There's also the language barrier and cultural disconnect. We may pretend that Oscars give a flying f*** about our art form, reality couldn't be farther from it.Very beautiful post OP. Wishing the same to you too.Nope, that killing was most probably a result of internal conflict that is being used by SFJ to drive a certain narrative.There's a marked difference in attitudes though. In the Indian context right wingism in first place doesn't fit with priorities of the wing as set by the west. Second, it's reactionary to decades of unfair drivel pushed by leftists.Hello, one ambulance equipped with burnol please.There's a possibility of that happening.Spot on. Had those citizens been white, nobody would've ever forgotten the incident. It'd have been imprinted in their brains.Very beautiful post OP, wishing the same to you too.We get emotional top quickly. And Trudeau's advisors know this it seems. His whole response is banking on knee jerk reactions from people on both sides of the issue.Down to earth, an Indian YT channel tackles such problems from India's perspective in quite some detail. Good post OP.Who cares, let it go to the Oscars. It's just clown to clown to reciprocation. Oscars being the slightly more sophisticated ones.That username though OP, hilarious.Brilliant post OP.No don't, expel is not killing. Their citizens have made such claims as a matter of record. This needs to be made clear, they're putting lives of active diplomats from other countries in jeopardy by not acting on such threats. No threats have been made to Canadian diplomats anywhere in India. Don't use kill, also stating that our external intelligence wing was involved in a certain extrajudicial killing on foreign land isn't right. This makes it very easy for their media to push the narrative by using farcical vox populi from Indian citizens as proof. They'll justify the drivel being pushed by SFJ and its lackies.He actually isn't two faced. His support to his subjects, especially pertaining to a certain religious minority in his country is very obvious. So obvious that other religious minorities have calls of leaving the country made against them and he hasn't/won't make any statements about it.Will start? Kanishka bombings?Who? If you're talking about a certain actor then it's better not to involve their ilk in this situation right now. This is at country level now, jesters shouldn't be involved in this at this point. They'll just obfuscate the matter further. Also, I think he's an Indian citizen now, I remember reading an article where he showed his citizenship status. Nevertheless, knowing bullywood, if they're involved in this, the issue will become a drivel and lose its focus.The news portal is pussyfooting around the issue. They just reported that his application was denied and after some time he started identifying as Canadian. They've obfuscated his legal status and subsequently not used the word illegal at all. Quite a clever tactic. They've in no uncertain words named the head of world's largest democracy as a religious nationalist. They've underlined the history of this particular guy's ideologue in some lines but fail to address or even talk about Sikh extremists and their acts in Canada, especially Kanishka bombing.It seems calling for genocide of Hindus using constitution as a crutch directly or indirectly is a universal theme.They'll side with him in some way or another.Megasusu, noice.Popcorn nahi khata to jhelta kaise?Eating different types of fruits.Croma provides its own brand of products in household items category in very reasonable pricing and with warranty. Moreover, repairing out of warranty or even in warranty second hand items is quite costly and inconvenient in cities like Bengaluru, Pune, Mumbai and such. I once called a refridgerator mechanic for a single door issue from Urbanclap (it's urban company now I think). The guy came in and stated that my electricals had an issue and there's also a possibility of compressor pressure loss. I asked him to show the problem, he tried some nonsense and then haughtily left with basic service charge levied and zero problem resolution. I raised an issue with urban clap. Nothing happened, eventually I just dove in with a multimeter and my father on videocall, found the issue and replaced the broken part which was only 80rs.Okay, understood. I've been called that a couple of times during my brief stay in Chennai. Never understood the context of it. I am not even North Indian, hilarious antagonization attempt to say the least.I know what vadakkan means but can you expand on its history a bit?Guessing by your username, you've been on the hit list for the past 800 odd years at the very least. A lot of damage has already happened and ironically a lot of the said damage has happened post independence.Good start OP, looking forward to other parts.India's own home made brand of exceptional secularism.Spot on üèÖPast matters, whether you want it to or not. It's better to clear the air beforehand and its even better to have a clean bill of health at hand, especially with the hookup culture around.Harsh, but true.This is a very common problem with Odia men of marriagable age OP. I hope you eventually find someone.Two wrongs don't make a right. Define each man? Have you surveyed all men in the country? What's the judicial respite provided for false accusations and subsequent mental/physical torchure that follows with it?Proof hai hi nahi to listen hi karengi sirf, aur kya.OP, you need to define what you want from a life partner. You also need to define what you need. Needs and wants both are important. Ask her the same questions, if those align then that's a good start. Next is to assess how adjustable both of you are with each other, that takes some time. Don't rush into it and all the very best.Status matters, looks is a matter of personal interpretation and interest. Status matlab paise ka status  nahi hota sirf. Thinking status, social status, value status ye sab mein basic equality necessary hai.It's quite an average masala entrainment for audience from that geography.Starlink is a fairly easy system to sabotage. If they go rogue and such a situation happens, electronic measures can be taken. Shooting the minisats out of LEO is absolutely out of question though. Iran might not have considered this contingency, starlink is set to launch in India it seems. Security agencies would've drafted some kind of containment plan for this too.Good to hear that the systen worked for somebody.Neither were they valid then nor are they now.What you've stated about Odisha is quite true, especially outside of major cities. But miss Allison isn't doing it for the sake of traditions, is she?I don't know anything about painting as an art, but that Gaur looks real and mesmerizing. Brilliant work OP.Kitne posters hai us par depend karta hai. Pondicherry mein kuch hi dikhenge.Truth.Asi sabnu bachaya si. It's racist to everybody; no exceptions. I am speaking as a veteran with more than 3000 days clocked there. As a collective hive mind the website does simp immensely for the EU, especially Germany.

WB GDP PPP for 2019-20 was about 1.20 lacs and 1.09 for Odisha.

Better yet, they can denote their work as complete fiction.Ignore karte karte hi ye haalat hai ab. We need to move forward knowing how people will try to and why they try to bismirch us. We cannot afford to ignore them either.Normally there's a provision to file a complaint for power surge and subsequent free meter. But since it's a part of bureaucracy, by the time they take cognizance of the issue years will pass and all the while you'll to be without electricity.I have been in the same boat as you OP, with almost the same authority. It was a property deed issue. Have also been at loggerheads with local municipality for waste collection and disposal, home water connection and some other issues.Quite an achievement if true. Let's see if they're able to do this in an affordable manner. Helium scarcity is only set to increase over time.I know that, my point is someone in France, Germany or the US doesn't. Unfortunately people take average diction and sly use of confusing English to be a sign of intellect.Yeah, first off OP, there's absolutely nothing weird in asking such a question. Everybody wants to look good for their big day. Everyone likes to be pampered, even if you find your parents pushing you towards it now. You will find yourself browsing those albums in coming years. Best way is to contact a videographer or a professional photo studio near your address. Go through their roster of previous shoots and you be very firm in what you like and require, they'll do the rest. All the best.This is just uno reverse keeping in view how proselytization towards Christianity has historically happened in India and keeps happening to this day. It's payback time I guess.The point is her rhetoric works as a match for people unaware of ground realities. Foreigners think she's an intellectual and take words as the truth.There's a veritable disconnect between odias on the internet and the ones on ground. We have no industry, bigger problem is, we don't even want it, especially the educated lot from inside and around the twin capital cities. I have seen people here feign and lean on the tinderbox that is the whole north south divide. All the while forgetting that none of it matters, South has a superiority complex, north has their own issues. Sometimes I see people here berate Gujarat, all the while Odia labors thrive in Gujarat. Surat, Ahmedabad, Jamnagar, you name it. The 'educated' ones have to find their home somewhere else because there's no industries in the state. I don't care for or propagate ban on languages, but people need to take a long hard look inwards rather than projecting it outwards. Some months ago there was a news of semiconductor manufacturing infrastructure being considered to be setup in Odisha. People here considered it as a joke and some said it isn't needed, i.e. high level industry needed rather blue collar jobs ought to do it. Our people have a weird disconnect with reality and with others inside the state itself. A Marathi anywhere in the world outside of Maharashtra will have camaraderie with other Marathi, same with Gujarati, same with Tamil. But rarely will one ever find an Odia doing the same. The people from bhubaneswar have a sense of entitlement and negligence towards people from other areas and so on.Puri ofcourse. Every other restaurant, hotels and small businesses are run by them. Especially on Gopal Ballav road. The staff, managers everybody will Converse in Bengali with you. If Odias are angry about this, we have nobody but ourselves to blame. It not then this comment just answering the post.Gives a subtle legitimacy to their acts. Readers of such articles then go on to think that maybe what they want is fundamentally ok, even if the means used aren't. Covertly conceited use of specific words.It was a joke.What hindu sentiments? The entire system has time and time proved that there's no sentiments attached with the so called majority religion. There's a reason Dr. Ranganathan made the 8th class citizen observation.OP, your gesture is appreciated. But there's no point in apologizing for what your government does. We're well aware of Trudeau's and Jagmeet's shenanigans.You already answered your question, because muh bhaichara. People in our country being delusional and lacking shatrubodh. Keep art separate, keep sport separate, keep lassun separate. All the while their regular people really just want to see us fail and get conquered by them. Our population thinks they dream of rosy bhaichara and aman-shanti dual emotions just like regular Indians. Having met their ilk regularly in neutral lands, the vitriol they have isn't hidden. And if someone wants to really get a hang of the situation, go and watch DD reacts on YT.Actually that's the third wave in the last month.

Apne biases ke upar hi khelte hai, aur khud hi ko uljhaake dusron ko suljhaane nikalte hai.I don't believe in such classifications but since your flair matches mine, it'd suffice to say that I come from Kalahandi. You can gleam the rest. Family was extremely poor and underprivileged, my father studied hard, got into central defence research and spent his life bringing others in the family up, including me. That passion trope is okay for people who either come from ancestral resources or have heavy contacts. I had none of those, only thing I had was persistence and my thorough understanding of what is called as haisiyat in Hindi. All of the modern media romanticism about following one's passion really isn't all its made to be. The most straightforward way to build one's life is to study, get good grades, get a job, survive the job, save money and not get tangled into other people's business. Baaki success stories ke peeche hazaaron failure log bhi hai, aur successful logon ke peeche bohot saara Paisa bhi.oney security rehne se hi aise sab kadam uthana sahi hota hai. Ashneer Grover ka example lelo, he comes from a very stable background. Tum sahi ja rahe ho abhi ke liye, paison par focus rakho aur life build Karo. Passion ke liye baad mein samay milega, agar current phase ko paar karo to. Don't overthink things and also don't fall into the fear of missing out waala chakraviewh.

Normal insaan kaam na kare to usko naukri se nikaal dete hai.Damn spot on.There's no need to take offense of this people. Clearly SC feels it right to threaten a particular religion and it's followers. DMK and its lackies have been doing this for decades and clearly their subjects from their home state like it too. No matter whatever A Raja said, or someone else said so many times. Its obviously legal, valid and appreciated if a particular religion and it's followers are brutally trolled in the name of personal laws, HR&CE act etc. Heck the way they've been on point since the statement came out, it's probably okay to say that they stand vindicated by their subjects. There's no pussyfooting involved here and the gerrymandering from all systems responsible under a supposed democracy is quite clear too, viz. legislature, bureaucracy and the mightiest judiciary.It's been proven time and time again that crackers during an annual event that lasts 1-4 days across the country doesn't even make a dent in pollution. Parali burning, diesel vehicles etc are far bigger contributors. Ban crackers, come out with some good reason for it, don't just parrot lame accusations. SC rejected studies presented about pollution markers. Nevertheless, SC also needs to come out with alternate employment schemes foe all involved in cracker making industry. Sivakasi will eventually fall and die.Achcha hua lock ho Gaya, itne irritating gyaan vardhak replies the ke kuch bolne laayak hi nahi bacha tha.If money if your primary goal then scout the market for uptrending skills. Get competent in them, basically scour every bone in your body to learn the skills. Get a job in that skill and slowly build your mark upwards. It's a bit of smart and hard work combined. If you fall into the trap of passion and other fancy terms it becomes difficult. Return on investment in terms of money, effort and time are the only metrics to go by for any job. Learn to like the job you do, neither your company, nor the people in it. This way you develop technical skills and some amount of poise and that will carry you through your 20s to early 30s. After that you can think or pursue whatever you think your passion is; iff (notice the double ff, it has a different meaning) you can afford it. Now ofcourse this track won't give you work life balance or satisfaction, you may/will miss out on your youth and activities associated with it. Slow down on the track if you want to enjoy life, look at broader perspectives and long term goals. Life passes by pretty fast, if you realise that you'll find your balance, all the best.The replies to that post were full of delusions, beyond imagination.Yeah that adage is a pathetic cop out in modern times.Forget about bringing political dolts into this each and every time. This requires action from the absolutely absolute, greatest of the great, the magnanimous ever magnificent, universally universal judiciary of ours. They're the only entity without zero oversight. Moreover, this also requires action from people of TN. If they want this to happen to them, then why's there even a need for others to harp on the issue?Gujaratis don't pay heed to such nonsense.DD reacts yt channel will help clear your basics about average Pakistani citizens and their thinking.Wahi to.Aye babua, nice one.Interesting how he used derogatory language to describe certain subs and calls you out. Quite funny really.Yeah that's a serious issue.Yeah, Zelensky is capable of that by proxy. What I am saying is pulling the strings of a German guy who is considered a troll by his own subjects to quite an extent won't be of any geopolitical use. Such lout mouths just operate on their own basis for the most part. They have an inner humming inside their their head that makes them do/state/ propagate such idiocy. Matlab interfere karte hai to pata hi hai, but ye pyaada jo aaj phadphadaya hai isko use karne ka koi sense nahi banta, distraction ke alawa.Arey o copium par high balderdash ke prachur gyaani mahatma.

Unki team ke cricketers are on record hating our so called majority religion. They're also on record stating conversion tactics with Indian team players. Apart from these they're also on record hating the country in general. Hamare chatore unki chaatne jaate hai uska kya karein?Debating requires extreme patience and very fast paced processing of topics. She's eloquent in her diction but debating is a different beast altogether.Even more comical is us sharing a land with WB to become a naxal state.China won't fund such a low-level troll. He's probably doing it at this own behest.That's alright mate with regards to telling part. The simplest way is to include a link when writing post description and for further explanation like in this particular representation, the meaning of quality that you can do as a comment. All the best.You need to post this when you make the post, also the definition of quality. It's not a criticism, rather proper understanding of what said pictorial representation entails. I did not make comments to any other posts made by you, because they were fairly straightforward. This representation isn't.You're still not answering the question. What does 'quality' mean here?I agree with your point here. Seasoned career bureaucrats hold a lot of power. My father doesn't care about the consequences. He's retired and was a researcher with some central defence org. His work was cannibalised by many. I asked him once about all of this, he just cared for his duties and that's it.Interesting, so since you have nothing to add you resort to abusive language.

Chal bata what does 'quality of education' mean in this particular representation. Aur kyunki wo nahi define Kiya hai to meaning kya Banta hai exactly is percentage ka? Gaali Dena aasaan hai, explain kar. Bina source ko dekhe, aur ye bhi batana ke kitne log actually jaake source ko padhke samjhenge ki quality ko kaise define Kiya hai.Not as many as you think, honest bureaucrats that is. I agree with the transfer point. And before you come at me with pitchfork, I have known the so called system inside out and have been at the receiving end of the said transfers for all my life through my father's occupation. The top guy need not be a political lackey too for that to happen. While it's always easy to blame legislative faces, the other two arms i.e. bureaucracy and judiciary are equally flawed, if not more or less. There's no point jn comparison here.Odia movie industry needs to take itself seriously first for the regular people to consider it as their primary source of entertainment.Finally, someone spoke the truth here.Yup, it's just pure balderdash nothing else.Yup, you got the point now. That's exactly what it is. The whole thing, i.e. this news and the reactions on it make no sense in the real world. It effectively does nothing. Though I am also extremely sceptical of honest bureaucrats point made by you. Nevertheless, you are right, even the one's who do their work diligently will have to be extremely careful.It's also about police not building a watertight case. Chain of custody for evidence is regularly tampered with. Protocols are not followed, heck sometimes/many times evidence just goes poof in the air or gets neglected altogether.See, first one has to win the case of accusation in court i.e they need to be proven innocent. Then they can ask for compensation as backpay on the basis of this accusation. Then the court will take it's sweet time to MAYBE provide you with the right for that backpay. Then the government will take it's sweet time to actually PROVIDE the backpay. Depends on the litigant how much time and money do they have for this. Money, because; well their lawyer also needs to be paid. If you are asking can this order itself be contested is court then, yes it can be. But that too requires resources.

Edit: innocence in first line is wrong. Technically it's not guilty. Innocense has more to do with societal acceptance and once such grave accusation has been levied that won't comeback.Okay, that's understandable. Even though I don't personally believe in such illusions of grandeur. If you do, I support you, I am not being sarcastic. I genuinely would support your gumption rather than the notion itself.We are regular people with zero pull. We survive the society, not change it.OP, I read your other post and this one too. You need to substantiate your claims a bit better. There are many shady characters in that State's performance arts industry and the new crop that is active since about last 2 decades especially so. But, people love their art for some reason. Fandoms are very difficult to sway away from their idols.There never was any quality there. My friends and I ventured there more than a decade ago. I saw the hygiene levels and decided to not enter. Had two vadapavs while going back to my college, my stomach had some refried cancer tier oil but no pathogens, at least that day.A convict as it is cannot hold such positions.No consequence, women lie under oath in the court and judges establish this many times and yet no repercussions befall the liers.A quick trial? In India?Source is provided in print, my contention is providing it in link. As such posts contain a lot to unpack and are not a simple case of pictorial representation. What does the presentation mean when what 'quality' entails isn't technically explained?Don't forget 498A, 375 and others in that realm.Then post the link, the source provided needs to fished put. Use basic data point entailed in the study with the post. That's not difficult. In this case important questions would be; what does quality of education mean and how people were surveyed.Drink as much water as your body needs. Body gives subtle symptoms, but those symptoms get masked through certain foods. Highly processed foods contain dangerous amounts of salts, sugars, stabilizers etc. These are a shock to the natural system in general. If these are avoided, gradually body comes back to its regular rhythm and your water urges start to align with body necessities. Waterr toxicity is a real thing and shouldn't bebtaken lightly. Moreover, everybody's is different and requires different amounts of water based on a myriad of factors like their physical activity level, mental activity level, bmi, food intake etc. Excess water causes heart strain too.OP, don't jump the gun. No note has been found and no cause has been established.We need more judges and a better jurisprudence too.What does the quality index entail? How was this survey done? How was the database made? What questions and quality markers were checked? How did the statistical percentage point come into being? How was the normalisation done? How was standard deviation achieved. Why are such post always devoid of crucial information? A simple graphical explanation and pictorial representation of data doesn't ever give the complete picture.This is the correct answer üèÖCall your credit card issuing bank's helpline and immediately block the card. You can ask them about your predicament and also tell them to reverse recent purchase made in past few days. Do this NOW. Sometimes we learn somethings the hard way. Next time when you get a card, use the issuing bank's mobile application to set permissions for the said card. Actually blocking the card and raising issue can be done through bank apps too.Are we discussing Indian cops here? What's with the whataboutery? Do you know how old this event is and did you ask why did it take so much time for axon bodycam footage to be released? Stick to the points made in the post and if you can't, make another one highlighting your issues with Indian cops. Don't cast shadows on issues by using another issue.You haven't heard of nawabi shauk it seems.Yup. We don't even need gora sahibs anymore to use cows as a tool of oppression, we have enough of our own populace to bark about it. Almost exclusively always through morphed/warped/mistranslated/misunderstood meanings of what's written in scriptures, sometimes through scientific findings without actually reading those findings and trying to make a connection of food habits. And lastly just plain vendetta. Just noticed, happy cake day mate.Sad to see the numbers from Odisha, but it's expected. Weirder is seeing the current CMs acceptance ratings, even with literally no work done outside of capital and it's neighbouring cities.Mate, muricans wiped out American bisons just because it was a significant source of survival for the natives. Hide, meat, milk, building material, hunting material etc were sourced from those animals. From about 50-60 million in late 18th century to some 500 animals in 1890.

Mostly on Mumbai, Pune and Nagpur subs.Makes sense.Trudeau is currently stuck in a power pickle. The party leaders that support Khalistani cause have him in their hold. If he tries to make a move against them, his seat will be in danger, if he supports he has to do things that other ethnicites from his country don't agree with. Nevertheless, till the time their politics doesn't affect us, it shouldn't matter. But alas, that's not the case and Canada is fast losing their grip of reality with respect to foreign relations with India. What's funny is countries like UK, Canada and many others think that they have a handle on such East meets West diversity shenanigans. Their whole history has been about conquering native lands and people, not being harmonious with them. And then they have the audacity to preach India on such matters. It's hilarious, downright pathetic and has now devolved to actually life threatening for people.We all know almighty bestest of bestest, universally perfect, epitome of truth, exceptionally excellent SC can do no wrong. Peasant, you're trying to cast aspertions on such an expedient entity, you shall be held in contempt, just wait for some time. Some law grad who's never seen a day in court may come and banish you from here for such an act.And who's surprised by this?He and Devdutta Pattnaik are two unfortunate products of my state perpetuating intellectual idiocy. Their thoughts need to be discarded.It's quite well deserved, not for most Canadians but for their polity. Especially Trudeau family.It's their ilk these lout mouths care for. Manish Kashyap from Bihar was in jail for months for asking questions.Okay, pose this question to judiciary and legislature, file a PIL. When/if matter proceeds to court ask your questions there. That's your prerogative and highest provided authority according to the current ruling document. My previous comment was sarcastic.Don't ask, just follow. You are a common citizen with zero pull.Chattisgarh government has passed an order today stating that even an accused in such cases where a female states a complaint, will be removed from his job. Brilliant I say.What law? SC freed him, he has all freedom of speech from entire universe. He cannot do no wrong, he cannot be wrong. Period.No exclusive to West. Everywhere around the world. West uses it in such a know-it-all standoffish way that it never makes sense. It's an extremely generic and easy way for them attack India. However, they don't know the history and complexities it contains.üèÖDogs need to be removed/euthanised/neutered from the streets asap. India has world's worst record when it comes to canine rabies.

Could this have been avoided through some kind of free market based laws and policies? Oh no, let's destroy the produce. Oh no wait, that shouldn't be done, let's introduce guarantees on certain crops that benefit only a certain type of farmers; let's call this msp. Woah, solutions everywhere.Ironic isn't it?Thank you kind sir, much appreciated.You're expecting non partisan thinking from Indian jurisprudence?I never said they didHow do you think a relatively small number of goras were able to pillage, plunder, starve, maime, enslave, exterminate, torture, persecute, imprison and muder us for centuries? By goras I don't mean just the brits. Many of those colonials were thinkers of our society as it's foundations were laid after independence. Their actions have shaped our current discourse.NopeJabardast reply. Scroll ka naam troll hona chahiye.Very beautiful post OP.Interstellar, Gravity, Tron: legacy, Oblivion; more times than I care to remember. The visual appeal of all these is stunning, same with sound design. Sanctum, Mad max: fury road, Edge of Tomorrow, Avatar, Top Gun: Maverick, the grand Budapest hotel; 4 times each. Engaging stories, really good SFX, VFX a bit of dystopian narrative mixed with hope, the underdog characterization is also interesting to note. Overall none of these are preachy or too overbearing, they're a fun experience. Brooklyn, Silver linings playbook, Before we go, One day; 3 times each. I found resonance with the stories presented in these.They've changed the locations 3 time in the past 15 years. From big hitters to guntha mantris; everybody is involved in this. Wherever the airport comes up, it will require dedicated transport corridor to support it.All minorities have castes, state OBC lists have many Muslim sections. According to supreme court ruling, caste status isn't lost even after conversions. Basically conversions are a hogwash to continue this segregation and perpetually keep on blaming atrocities since the time of big bang. And what's equality is the question to ask here. Once that's established let's also ask the system where this said equality is.I have no words to be honest. Very good post OP.The empire is responsible for even more deaths once all of their dominions are taken into account.Can you define and subsequently expand on the truth aspect?*persecuted.*Neo Buddhists.Because of your skin color. Indian brown man has been ostracized to be the lowest of the low in the order of desirability. This isn't something that happened overnight. Meek, creepy, vile, non-chalant brown Indian men who are mama's boys and have rapey vibe is something that has been perpetuated by Indian and western media alike. Can't do anything about it. Your best bet would be a kind Midwestern gentrified white girl, if you are in the US. They may seem like basic women but are quite sensitive and surprisingly amazing.I have already provided an example in my original comment. I have no power to stop you from doing anything. Just gave a suggestion. Donyou have conclusive proof that his wife was a Brahmin? It's not a free country, actions have consequences, in such situations, unrequited ones.

Edit: you need to comprehend better, I never claimed to he oppressed of anything.TrueThatnk you for the comment, Inwas unaware of such happenings.Yup, deflection and whatboutism.Sorry I mistook you for someone else. Nevertheless I appreciate your thorough responses very much.My personal thoughts about him are way too anger inducing for anybody to comprehend it. I have to refrain every time this topic comes up, in real life too I have had to face such ire from people, even when presenting my opinions with proofs. There are many fields he did not have any knowledge about and yet he's revered for his opinions for some reason. I have this very same opinion, tenacity and arguments about many other social reformers from the past 2 centuries. Nevertheless, my comment is very simple, we as individuals cannot fight the system, a system that is run by a document that contradicts itself with each page turn and is highly selective in it's treatment of subject matter that it considers as sacrosanct, based on it's arbitrary biases.They never blame Bangladeshis for anything. They actually don't even bear the brunt of what Bangladeshi immigrants do to their state. They're oblivious to it. States like Assam, Odisha and Tripura bear the consequences of it all. While they live in their oblivious bubble, especially people from Kolkata, outside the city they still understand the core issues. But that city's dwellers have a serious issue with self introspection.Is this a new alt guruji?He's succeeding. People belonging to his language are supporting his rhetoric, massively so. They've also brought his party to power inspite of knowing what they stand for.This is from CAA-NRC protests in 2019 before corona hit.They'll justify it.You've got empirical proof of Biharis perpetrating this? You're the one who started divisive agenda and tried finding common grounds with a people who've historically been thrown out of their original dwelling due to issues of violence and general non-compliance with laws. Yet, you brought commonality or language as some kind of connection point.That's their default mode. They blame everyone else for their problems.It was about power then, it is about power now. Nehru made those comments then because his position was challenged by someone. Congress today wants power, hence the support. Former prime minister's comments then weren't stanadlone observations based on a random person's actions. The description was a political tool to instabilize Periyar's position.Would the complainant survive?No they aren't a concept of Hinduism. Don't make those equations just to force a friendship. That never works the way it's intended do. They want a separation of entities, give it to them.Given their cognitive dissonance, they'd probably like it that way.Thank you for the detailed comment, I appreciate it a lot. Please do post whatever sources you may find. I looked into the Twitter handle you mentioned, it's a good start. Thank you again.Yes, thank you for posting about that judge as a public comment. Everybody needs to know about the bigotry that goes on in the most powerful institution without oversight. That too in world's largest democracy by number of people.Actually no, if that is a girl, society probably values her for many things and has given her this entitlement. She'll get to the know reality sooner or later, reality of her own being that is. In the meanwhile with respect to western standards, both Indian men and women stand nowhere. For most white men brown girl is a checklist item to tick and clear.Two wrongs don't make a right. Whatboutism karna hai to tujhe to reply mat kar. Comprehension tera weak hai agar to usko strong kar pehle jaake.Her statements are really ironic considering how self contradicting the document that she uses to give her judgements is.In that particular case it was saddening to see SCs response to her requests and their pontifications with regards to her statements.Yup, I have heard stories from people currently in their 60s.Yup, this needs to be called out now. And the recent remark presents for an opportunity to being out things that have been relegated to untold yet traumatic history. Can you give me a link for the book please?The nonsense they pulled with regards to president not being invited was seriously a low blow and downright hilarious. You're right about hypocrisy to be called out, if nothing happens this just emboldens them to put out even more ridiculous statements later. The unfortunate part here is, such heinous statements does not accord any response from our judiciary, an institution that hitherto claims exceptional moral authority in other matters.Nobody can deny that in the past 3-4 centuries there have been atrocities on so called lower castes. That has resulted in them being downtrodden and stigma being attached to them. But the stigma part is taken care off when they convert to Neo Buddhism/Christianity/Islam; but still they're able to retain their 'dalit' status. Then financially well off criteria is never verified. Moreover, criticism of such policies and public figures that people belonging to said categories revere can/does/will attract SC/ST act against them which is a serious cognizable offence. Amidst all of this there are so many students from so called non lower caste strata with almost no or meagre means of survival, they have no representation anywhere.1. How judicial and bureaucratic reforms were implemented in India. 
2. Raageshwari loomba new song if it ever happens. 
3. Meenakshi Seshadri new movie if it ever happens.What's the context and who is the other player?Yup, as sad as the situation is it's the only truth we have. The whole system is a weird maze of anomalies, paradoxes and literal oxymorons getting validated on basis of where the system's priorities lie at present.Yup, you're right. He's lit the fire and this will now be backed by people to burrow into people's minds. State and city subs are cess pools at this point, we're both already aware of our beloved city sub going that way.That's unfortunately true. The side that advocates diversity so much doesn't understand that diversity of thoughts, ideologues and subsequently intellects is also a thing.Okay, so say that. TN doesn't have exclusive dominion over temples and their architecture. You can say it's a land with so many beautiful temples, and that'd be factual. The way your sentence is worded it reads as if it's the only place with temples.Mate, read my comment again, I am on your side. Just don't trust the system to protect the truth.I agree with your words completely and have actual proofs provided by the person under discussion here. I just don't trust the system to come to my aid if I state the truth though. Hence my suggestion to not say anything at all. Truth isn't worth it if it puts you behind bars through nonsense non-bailable IPC and CrPC sections. Kaalkothri mein dhwast ho jaata hai sabkuch.Thoda clearly likho please, once I understand your comment I will edit this one. Thank you.Taking a violent recourse to this just proves his point. I am not saying that nothing should be done,  but actions that prove his point are going to be counter productive. I personally don't care what political parties will do. They have their own agendas. It's the common people that should come out in protest to his words.Isn't this violation of human rights? The same human rights that DMK people want to safeguard? Or so called upper castes don't have human rights is it?Why is Tamil Nadu land of Hindu temples? The terms are both quite old in their existence.You have serious comprehension issues. Make any assumptions and form subsequent affirmations as you wish.

Edit: Southern cities developed faster due to availability of sea, development of sea ports and passing of major trade routes through those ports. These provided for first mover advantage and hence industrialization happened at a relatively better pace. There are many other reasons too, but something gives me the feeling that any discussion about that isn't going to work.I stated a simple question based on my personal experience and general observations. I did not use your state's name. Ironically out of living in the 3 different Southern states, my experiences in SDSC or SHAR as it was called in those days is the most positive. You are taking this way too personally, and I cannot do anything about that. Read my original reply again for clarity. I asked a very simple question of security being provided to news offices in the event of them stating things that the general population doesn't agree with. By hero worship I didn't mean actors, I meant politicians. If we are talking about movies then I have seen enough clashes between Mahesh Babu Pawan Kalyan fans, Prabhas and others' fans etc, heck even Ajith fans with others. I personally don't care for such clashes. News is a different ballgame, especially when it involves people from North presenting their perspectives on status quo in South. I am not privy to what people in your offices are like nor does that comparison mark it's relevance here. Just FYI, I am not from the so called North.Yes, my question isn't rhetorical. I have experienced animosity while living in 3 different Southern states. You haven't experienced it, good for you. Do you want to be a guaranter for actions of everyone who claims to be from the South?

Edit: fanaticism isn't a function of joblesseness. Anybody can be fanatic if their belief in a certain ideologue is beyond reasonable.Not really, he knows the ones he's calling out have no clout to challenge him in any way whatsoever. Freedom of speech is on his side, when someone else says stuff like this, which ironically is factual they're reprimanded by the highest court of this country by stating 'loose tongue set the country on fire'.Mercy as a word hits hard in this sentence.It's a very difficult question to answer. While the scary elements are always armed to the brim with guns, sharp and blunt implements, general population isn't. Police is ineffective in providing protection, due to training, funding and overall number issues. If general population is given this facility then shootings will increase and so will the case load for such incidents in judiciary. The same judiciary that is massively inept in working on the current caseload that they face. Common people have no recourse, keep quiet and try to not offend anybody whomsoever under any circumstances. Nobody from the system is coming to help/protect before the fact/provide justice after the fact.Will they be provided security in their offices when they post/state/pontificate on things that the population there does not like? Hero worship is a serious issue in states South of Maharashtra.Mate when you make such  positive posts, you ought to explain what it entails.I doubt TN Hindus will take to the streets. I doubt any 'secular' person cares when such bile is regurgitated against the so called majority religion of this country.Don't even say that. You'll end up in jail. His excellence cannot be contested whatsoever. You should be aware that icons like him are above any kind of criticism, for reference Google the recent case about a reformer from Maharashtra and bharadwaj speaks.One reply isn't going to change anything. The whole narrative set down since Periyar's time needs to be broken down. Nevertheless, this reply is good. Udaynidhi has already stated on twatter that he isn't scared of legal action and he's right. What he and others like Owaisi junior etc state isn't hate speech. Can't be, it isn't possible whatsoever. However when a woman speaks facts, and a doctored video of her words is presented as proof she's reprimanded by exceptionally excellent universally correct stupendously brilliant judges as a 'loose tongue setting fire to the country'. If someone has reactions from regular people of that particular state kindly point me to those, I'd like to see how they've rationalised this ultra secular stance.People in this post's comment have taken 'rational' thought approach without considering your complete post. They just read the last paragraph tldr version. I am seeing 'logical' and 'objective' approaches on a matter that doesn't require it. It's very clear that Sikhs want to break away from Hinduism, fine do it. In doing that they've been derogating others' customs and this propaganda is a part of that. And it shouldn't be. Be whatever kind of religion you want to be, there's no use pontificating and dragging others down with you. Alas, people opine before they comprehend. Nevertheless, good post OP.Okay, good for you.Again, you shouldn't comment on issues you can't comprehend.Are you sure you understand that word and it's implications? Who let you on the internet?They can make, break and strike laws whenever they deem necessary.Should've gotten divorced first then, it's as simple as that. She's the first offender here, not the other way around.Sorry but once boinking happens it's quite difficult to reconcile. Moreover if what he says is true and threats have been hurled at him, it's better to separate him from such a toxic situation as soon as possible.He should also understand that he will have to pay maintenance irrespective of whatever happens further. He should also understand that entangling with Indian bureaucracy will leave him penniless. Best way is to file for a no contest divorce in as sweet way as possible. Not to say that it won't be a shit show but in accordance to Indian jurisprudence, women can do no wrong. So he really has no recourse.People will do what they deem appropriate. Itne se clip jisko chaant kar koi vakta uske upar param gyaan dekar dusron ko glaani mein daal Raha hai aur us par se koi mentality ko judge karke dekh raha hai to wo bhool hai. Tujhe kya lagta hai us mein nera koi input nahi hai, you believe what you want to. A short clip like that doesn't present a succinctly complete picture of the situation, to derive any amount of objective conclusions.Sapne suhane ladakpan keMy point isn't about pronunciations. Read the comment again. I don't personally care for language or even pronunciations here. My point is about rightful ownership being twisted into perverted versions of an actual practice, viz. Hot yoga, yoni sunning, yin yoga and many such idiosyncratic practices.1 minute ke naare se kuch nahi bigadta hai kahin bhi. Bachche wahan bohot kuch karte hai. Itni si clip se kuch kayaas lagakar badi badi tukbandiyan karna bewakufi se jyada kuch nahi hai. Jyada gyaan dene waale bohot baar kaala akshar bhians barabar ki parakashtha hote hai.Same here, naare bhi lagaye hai nautanki bhi ki hai. IITB se master's hai. Jahan kisiko kuch useless lag sakta hai wahi baat kisiko necessary lag sakti hai. Iska selection se actually koi relevance hai bhi nahi.Selection waise bhi ek bohot Kam hi percentage ka hona hai, irrespective of kitne question kaun laga Raha hai aur kitna fanatic hai.Everyone does except for actual Hindus. They're busy in sarvgaram vadapav and not asserting rightful ownership over it. In near future some whites will be selling them downward dog pose stating how it's scientifically proven through medical journals, present in APA format and gullible, naive natives will gulp it down. They'll also create patents and IP rights and subsequently claim royalties on it.Don't forget yoga originated in Africa nonsense.The poster is a cretin, judging everyone around her from her high horse and expects everyone else to bow down to her opinions. Such nonsense is to be shunned entirely and each person should do whatever is right in accordance to their exigent circumstances.Not when one factors number of students present in the city and its vicinity. This comment isn't condoning the suicides, rather presenting you the complete picture.Change the scheme's name at least. It's for all students belonging to a category not just medhavi ones.Sorbitrate 10mg is too heavy a dose, 5mg is good enough for most cases. Source: my cousin underwent angioplasty with 3 stents at the age of 30. I have asked his interventional cardiologist about the use of sorbitrate and its dosage.I don't have anything to say about any other states and their issues. After your statement that EU does not have to pour resources to sustain labour force, this tete a tete is over. You're welcome to live your delusions.Of course it's a hyperbole, to make a point. EU is dealing with a serious refugee crisis. This will drive the political discource in coming years. While unskilled population additon may not seem like a big deal, an unruly population that doesn't contribute via taxes or pther productive means is why India remains behind in the world. As an example, just last week about 4200 refugees, mostly working age males have arrived on Lampedusa Island. How many more can Italy and by extension EU take in?

Edit: with regard to the hyperbole itself, larger EU cities have been facing issues like homelessless, riots, ethnic tensions, increase in number of ghettos and crime. City administration has not found effective solutions to these issues. Smaller, quaint and relatively homogenously populated areas like yours have been good though.I stated to you in my first reply that I have no function of pride in my comment. Now you have switched to ego. I have neither. You want to see things which aren't there I cannot do anything about it. Being from a state doesn't make me lose objectivity. Odisha hasn't developed inspite of having resources is because of not developing self sufficiency and whining, whinging, paying obeisance to other states. Same is the case here, albeit at an international level. EU is better, objectively so. You think there's no problem there, good for you, as I stated before,  I am not here to argue with you. Earth has enough supply and demand based resource allocation availablity for 10 billion people. You want to tackle population debate, start with your upcoming generations. Brain drain will keep on continuing. That's how natural flow of humanity works. OECD block doesn't have blue collar workers, they find refugees. They need white collar workers, Indians are available. Their downfall isn't going to create long term problems for Asian countries as a whole.I am not here to argue with you. You want to tackle the population issue, I have already provided you with a discourse. I am aware of supply and demand. If providing jobs to downtrodden from other third world countries with 'relevant skills' would've been viable they'd have implemented it already.Good for you. Your current living conditions are exemplary, no doubt about it. I never made a comparison with India. I personally don't care where you live. My comment is based on future prospects.Nothing in my comment is about pride. I personally don't view population as a downgrade. EU and many other landmasses will be requiring people to support their countries as they have an ageing population and many countries are below bare minimum replenishment levels. Their current issue is providing refuge to non-productive people. This has hampered legal immigration and will subsequently lead to other socio-economic and socio-political problems. My comment is about their arrogance and preachy discourse towards the world. Also, don't extrapolate a simple comment using jibes such as flattery and stubbornness. Learn to comprehend. Moreover, wherever my country's system needs correction I provide my inputs as a duty bound citizen. I have lived in the EU long enough to differentiate between their workings and ours. You want to curb population growth, start with your upcoming generation.You've given her a piece of your mind, now block her and move on. Asshats aren't worth anybody's time.You've given her a piece of your mind, now block her and move on. Asshats aren't worth anybody's time.In a word, yes. Powerful, sustainable, better human conditions overall.üèÖGood for you for believing this. The interpretations are subjective, duties prescribed aren't. I never refuted aghoris, I don't have a negative view of them. Especially since I am a practicing shakta, I know very well how they work. Same about yogis. Same about kings and paupers.  I vehemently disagree with the 'way of life' discourse and by extension not a religion discourse. Culture did put restrictions, there's a difference between restrictions and outright banishments. Even they're necessary for a civilization to survive and for a culture to thrive. We were accepting of other religions and cultures because of our naivete that we have masked with goodness of our heart jargon. We still refuse to correct this discourse head on  and it continues to be a detriment for us. Turks and others were able to rule and destroy us due to the same reason.Visited your denomination's church and socialize with the families there. That could be your starting point.Meh, let them do that. Their cities are crumbling and so is their demographical balance. It will be apparent in the coming decades as Gaddafi's prophesy comes to complete fruition.The moment you talk actual sanatan with Indian right wing, you'll get abused.Usko nahi Lena hai accountability of her own decisions. She's miserable, she wants the world to be too.Dead spot on.Well, it's understandable given Chennai politics and it's affinity with incestuous characters.It's better as chess requires using mental facilities that work best in isolation. Also; glamor sells, that's as ancient as civilization itself. Not a big deal, everything is how it's supposed to be.Just Punjabi version of Earth saakeen hai, gardish nahi karti.Objectively more, there's no argument.1. Don't assume my gender.
2. My comment was from a biological point of view, completely separate from social constructs.
3. Personally don't care for linguistic classification of anything. 
4. The person in the video isn't referring to linguistic demarcations and differentiations either.
5. My comment has no bearing on my own gender in any way. It's a comment on abjectly moronic statement presented by the speaker in the post.That's understandable, sm is a cesspool if one let's it drag them down.Prabhu.Spot on.External validation that makes one feel special about themselves is the only aim here. Don't pay too much heed to such people, that's what they want.Yeah it's patriarchal, there are many matriarchal festivals too. Deal with it, plain and simple.Good to see you mate. Is this an alt?TOIlet paper for a reason. They and their ilk are well known for self righteous bile and unnecessary sermonizations. Not that such profound preach stopped one of their own from commenting on bust sizes of random actresses.Spot on with the second paragraph. With regards to the first one's opening line, see it's very simple; the hate wasn't accessible through anonymous means and a wide range of availability. Both of these are provided by platforms like this one. Hence, such disgusting statements are even more visible now. I and my family had to move around a lot as my father was employed in a central gov scientific establishment. I have felt the judgement, slurs, discrimination first hand. Just as an example; when chidambaram was finance minister, I had an argument with a friend's father who revered chidambaram a lot. The reason being state based commonalities and how mr. finance minister was such an austere person and how a non malayali can never understand malayali work ethic. I quipped straight away that a communist state actually has no work ethics. Needless to say he never talked down to me again. You could see judgment in his eyes in that moment, not that it wasn't there before but he did not expect a reply from a kid from an impoverished state.

Edit: with regards to the current ruling party being at loggerheads, 13th VP of our country summed it up quite nicely in an earlier address as an MP. BJP, from their Jan sangh days has been in opposition and knows how to be an opposition party. Congress doesn't, all they have ever known is ruling by any means necessary. You can clearly see that from their tirade of baseless accusations to name calling to walkouts, stalling of ordnances and bills; the list is endless.That's cruelty against brahmos. He's a CCP shill, give him some time to actually function with his colleagues, especially in flood terrain regions of China.This is irrespective of hate against the current government. Every new generation since the past 5 odd decades does this. The cycle is self sustainable now, only the slur changes but the feeling remains constant. They get even more emboldened because of almost zero on ground pushback from Gujaratis. Their numbers maybe small but their virulent vitriol is quite loud.A lot of Neo Tamils do use it as a slur. Although they don't understand it's background even in the slightest. Mostly just internet afflicted new gen edgy kids. Notice the use of derogation against Sinhalese people too.Hmm, gobar jibe. Oddly specific and clearly points towards your biases. Good on you to have used that retort, makes the case for your intent.Central government employees not receiving their salary even for a single month will create extreme furore. Diggi and his ilk need to be accountable for their words.Just bhadraloke things.Way too many edgy dolts around it seems.This sounds really wrong though, the meetha line.That's going to be a long answer, give me some hours to compose my thoughts properly and present something in a concise manner.Thank you for acknowledging that, I understand it's very difficult to state what you did, respect. Passion, interest, hustle; all of these jargon terms are quite fancy and don't really apply to most folks of the country. Moreover as significant amount of time is spent in pursuits with zero or negligible future prospects. Humanities and arts are very noble pursuits but nobility of a certain track does not pay the bills. Our first priority should always be to secure our livelihood based on our current exigent circumstances. People forget very easily that for every Ashneer Grover there are literally thousands of failed entrepreneurs. Life isn't about being in a constant positivity trap, it's about being pragmatic. You are a BA in what stream?Doesn't impart real time acumen in line with market forces. Thus the taker ends up not having money earning skills. Irrespective of what pop culture might state, money is what matters the most. Especially for a low level per-capita income country like India. That being said, I don't think it's unnecessary, but it cannot be one's main pursuit. Compare the better faring states of India, by better I mean per capita income and living conditions in general plus industrialization markers and relatively peaceful existence. Now compare them with other other states while cross referencing the respective percentage of higher education takers grouped by technical subjects and humanities. It's quite intuitive and interesting.Can't really compare to that guy, I personally despise him very dearly.It's not.I said worth it's price. Way too many takers, almost no jobs.1. Humanities degree is worth it's price
2. Indian jurisprudence is non-partisan
3. Bureaucracy is here to serve peopleAnd you believed otherwise before?So when your country took birth, the population %age of Hindus was around 20 and now it's at around 8. You want to preach nonsense, kindly stay in your lane while doing so.Spot on.Taxes aren't European, CCP labor laws exist just to torchure their laborers.People self victimize when getting a reality check. Shocking. Most comments want it to end because of its discriminatory nature. Doubly shocking. People never coming up with a rational reply to the questions asked, because there isn't any. More shocking than someone sitting on a pantograph and hitting 25kV live wire.
