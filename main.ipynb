      "In the Bhagvad Gita, Lord Krishna teaches that the path to inner peace and contentment lies in self-realization and detachment from material desires. When one becomes alone, it is an opportunity to turn inward and connect with the divine within oneself.\n",
      "\n",
      "Lord Krishna advises that one should focus on spiritual practices such as meditation, yoga, and chanting the holy names of God. These practices help to calm the mind and bring a sense of peace and tranquility.\n",

      "Furthermore, Lord Krishna emphasizes the importance of detachment from material desires and attachments. He explains that all material possessions and relationships are temporary and fleeting, and true happiness can only be found within oneself.\n",

      "Therefore, when one becomes alone, it is a chance to let go of worldly attachments and focus on the eternal and unchanging nature of the soul. By cultivating a strong connection with the divine within oneself, one can find lasting happiness and fulfillment, even in the midst of solitude.\n",
